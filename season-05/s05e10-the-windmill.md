## 4. Structural Layout

- **Left:** Small barn structure with darker roof positioned on hillside; fence line extends downward
- **Right:** Tall windmill tower with fan blades creates strong vertical element; fence posts recede into distance
- **Center:** Round barn or storage building sits on elevated middle ground; rolling hills flow across
- **Foreground:** Winding stream or pathway cuts through snow with pronounced shadows and highlights
- **Background:** Purple sky fills upper third with dynamic cloud movements; distant treeline suggests far horizon

Depth style: **Layered hillside recession with strong foreground path leading to elevated farm structures**

---

## 5. Motion

- Winding stream or path creates S-curve movement through foreground
- Windmill blades suggest rotational energy
- Cloud formations sweep across sky with directional flow
- Rolling hills create gentle wave-like rhythm
- Snow drifts imply wind patterns across terrain
- Diagonal path pulls viewer's eye from lower left toward buildings

---

## 6. Technique

- Heavy palette knife work for snow highlights and drifts
- Liquid White or Liquid Clear base allows color blending in sky
- Fan brush creates delicate windmill structure and fence posts
- Oval brush builds cloud formations with circular strokes
- Knife pulls create sharp snow edges and dimensional ridges
- Dry brush technique for weathered building textures
- Cross-hatching strokes define shadow areas in snow

Signature technique: **Palette knife snow sculpting with dramatic purple sky blending**

## 7. Narrative Layer

"A working farm endures the quiet isolation of winter, its windmill standing sentinel over snow-draped hills. The purple twilight sky suggests the day's end, when farmwork pauses and the cold silence deepens. This is a landscape of perseverance—simple structures weathering the season, a stream still flowing beneath ice and snow, human enterprise harmonizing with nature's cycles."

## 8. Initial Canvas Treatment

- Liquid White or Liquid Clear applied across entire canvas
- Purple and Lavender immediately blended into wet sky area
- Sky worked top to bottom with large brush
- Canvas preparation allows smooth color transitions in clouds
- Base coat enables knife work to glide across surface for snow effects

Sky-dominant preparation with wet-on-wet foundation enabling seamless purple atmosphere and crisp snow sculpting.
