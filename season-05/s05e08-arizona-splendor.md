## 1. Composition

- Massive rocky cliffs dominating the left third with dramatic vertical thrust
- Winding stream flowing from background to foreground through center
- Cluster of bare deciduous trees in center and right, creating skeletal framework
- Warm desert vegetation in golden yellows and sage greens along stream banks
- Soft blue sky with subtle gradation suggesting clear desert atmosphere
- Sandy earthen path along stream edge in foreground

A desert oasis composition anchored by monumental stone and life-giving water.

## 2. Palette

- Warm yellows and golds for desert scrub and autumn grasses
- Cool blues in water reflections and sky
- Titanium White and grays for sunlit cliff faces and shadows
- Burnt Sienna and earth tones for sandy banks and shadows
- Sage greens mixed with yellows for arid vegetation
- Subtle pinks and lavenders in sky and cliff highlights

Palette identity: **Desert warmth meets cool mountain stone**

---

## 3. Mood & Atmosphere

- Serene and expansive desert tranquility
- Warm, inviting quality despite arid setting
- Sense of discovery and natural refuge
- Contrast between harsh geology and soft vegetation creates harmonious balance
- Clear, dry air quality typical of Southwest high desert

Lighting: **Bright overhead sun** casting strong shadows on cliff faces while illuminating the golden vegetation.

## 4. Structural Layout

- **Left:** Towering rocky cliffs with sharp shadows and bright highlights, establishing monumental scale
- **Right:** Bare trees and desert vegetation creating softer, organic counterpoint
- **Center:** Stream serving as primary compositional pathway, drawing eye from background to foreground
- **Foreground:** Sandy bank with water's edge, grasses, and reflective stream surface
- **Background:** Continuation of cliff formations extending upward, establishing depth and grandeur

Depth style: **Linear perspective along stream corridor with massive vertical anchors**

---

## 5. Motion

- Stream flows smoothly from distant background toward viewer
- Gentle curves in water course create S-curve compositional flow
- Vertical thrust of bare tree trunks provides upward movement
- Wind suggested in lean and gesture of bare branches
- Eye travels along water path then upward along cliff faces

---

## 6. Technique

- Heavy knife work for cliff faces, building texture and dimension
- Highlight scraping on rock surfaces for sunlit edges
- Fan brush for bare tree foliage and delicate branch structure
- Liner brush for thin tree branches and fine details
- Liquid clear technique for water reflections and flow
- Push-pull method for desert vegetation using various greens and yellows
- Vertical pulling strokes for cliff shadows

Signature technique: **Dramatic knife-built cliffs with delicate fan brush trees**

## 7. Narrative Layer

"An oasis stream cuts through Arizona's desert landscape, where ancient stone monuments rise against endless sky. Bare trees mark the seasons even in this arid realm, their skeletal forms framing the life-giving water below. The contrast between monumental geology and delicate vegetation speaks to nature's balance—harsh and gentle, permanent and fleeting, united in splendor."

## 8. Initial Canvas Treatment

- Light sky blue wash across upper canvas
- Possibly subtle pink or lavender tones blended into sky area
- Thin base color establishing atmospheric perspective

Foundation emphasizes luminous desert sky as backdrop for dramatic landforms.
