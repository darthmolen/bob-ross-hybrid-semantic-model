# Season 5, Episode 9 — "Anatomy of a Wave" (1987)

---

## 1. Composition

- Single large breaking wave dominates the left-center, showcasing wave structure
- Expansive ocean extending to distant horizon on right
- Foreground water with rippled surface and wave patterns
- Bright turquoise sky with minimal cloud definition
- Two seabirds in flight adding scale and movement
- Clean horizon line dividing sky from distant ocean

The composition serves as an anatomical study of wave mechanics and translucency.

---

## 2. Palette

- Bright turquoise and cyan for luminous sky
- Deep Prussian Blue and violet tones in foreground water
- Brilliant Sap Green and Pthalo Green in wave's translucent body
- Titanium White for foam, spray, and wave crest
- Subtle lavender and purple undertones in water shadows
- Light blue highlights on distant ocean surface

Palette identity: **Tropical seascape with translucent wave anatomy**

---

## 3. Mood & Atmosphere

- Dynamic and energetic coastal scene
- Bright, clear daylight conditions
- Focus on educational demonstration of wave structure
- Sense of power and fluid motion captured in single moment
- Clean, uncluttered atmosphere emphasizing wave form

Lighting: **Direct overhead sunlight** illuminating the wave's interior and creating translucent green effect.

## 4. Structural Layout

- **Left:** Primary breaking wave with white foam crest and cascading spray
- **Right:** Open ocean vista extending to horizon with calm water
- **Center:** Translucent green wave body showing interior structure and light penetration
- **Foreground:** Blue-violet water with horizontal ripples and wave texture
- **Background:** Distant horizon line with lighter blue ocean meeting turquoise sky

Depth style: **Minimal depth with emphasis on wave cross-section**

---

## 5. Motion

- Wave captured mid-break showing forward curl and upward spray
- Foam and white water cascading down wave face
- Horizontal ripples in foreground suggesting continuous wave action
- Seabirds in flight adding directional movement
- Implied wind direction shown through spray pattern
- Dynamic energy frozen in moment of wave collapse

---

## 6. Technique

- Wet-on-wet blending for translucent green wave interior
- Fan brush for foam texture and spray effects
- Palette knife for sharp highlights on wave crest
- Horizontal brush strokes for foreground water ripples
- Light touch for atmospheric sky gradation
- Layered whites for dimensional foam structure
- Transparent glazing technique showing light through wave

Signature technique: **Translucent wave interior using layered greens and whites**

## 7. Narrative Layer

"This piece functions as both artwork and instruction, revealing the hidden architecture of a breaking wave. The translucent green body exposes the wave's interior while white foam traces its dynamic energy. Minimal surrounding elements keep focus on the wave's anatomy, demonstrating how light, water, and motion converge in a single powerful moment along the coast."

---

## 8. Initial Canvas Treatment

- Light turquoise or cyan base applied across sky area
- Darker blue foundation for water sections
- Smooth, even initial layer allowing wave elements to stand forward
- Minimal texture in base to emphasize wave detail

The bright, smooth foundation provides contrast for the complex wave structure.
