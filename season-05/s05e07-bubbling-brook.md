- Palette knife work for water highlights and reflective surfaces
- Wet-on-wet blending for atmospheric background and sky
- Vertical downward strokes for tree trunks
- Highlight technique with bright yellows tapped onto tree foliage

## 7. Narrative Layer

"A meadow brook winds its cheerful path through sunlit grassland, its waters dancing over smooth stones with playful energy. Birch and deciduous trees stand as quiet witnesses along the verdant banks, their leaves catching golden light beneath a soft morning sky. The scene invites the viewer to follow the water's journey through this peaceful sanctuary where nature flows undisturbed."

## 8. Initial Canvas Treatment

- Liquid White applied across entire canvas for luminous wet-on-wet foundation
- Blue-gray tones blocked in for sky area
- Background mist and atmospheric effects established early
- Dark values placed for water base before highlights added

Foundation approach establishes luminous underpainting that allows brilliant greens and blues to glow.
