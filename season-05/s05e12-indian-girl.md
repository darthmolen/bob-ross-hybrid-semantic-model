## 7. Narrative Layer

"A portrait celebrating Native American heritage through traditional adornment and ceremonial warmth. The subject emerges from a glowing background that suggests both sunset fire and spiritual radiance, creating an iconic representation that honors cultural identity. The geometric precision of the headband and the natural elements of feather and turquoise beading ground the figure in specific cultural context while the radiant backdrop elevates the portrait to symbolic significance."
