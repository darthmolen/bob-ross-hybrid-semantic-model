## 7. Narrative Layer

"An abandoned homestead rests peacefully in a sun-drenched spring meadow, where a clear stream winds through golden grasses toward the viewer. The old barn stands as a quiet remnant of rural life, watched over by sentinel trees while nature reclaims the land with exuberant growth. This is countryside in its most inviting state—warm, bright, and alive with the simple beauty of an untended pastoral landscape."

## 8. Initial Canvas Treatment

- Liquid White applied generously across entire canvas
- Bright foundation allows maximum color brilliance
