"A hidden pond emerges from morning mist in a meadow bathed in golden light. The world seems suspended between sleep and waking, where solid forms dissolve into luminous atmosphere. A lone tree stands witness to this quiet transformation, its dark silhouette the only anchor in a landscape of pure light and warmth."
