# Season 20, Episode 11 — "Change of Seasons" (1990)

## 1. Composition
A winding stream flows through the foreground of a mountain valley, flanked by contrasting seasonal vegetation. On the left, tall evergreen conifers stand dark and steadfast against the sky, while on the right, deciduous trees glow with golden autumn foliage. Majestic snow-capped mountains rise in the center background, their peaks catching the warm light of a dramatic sunset sky painted in brilliant pinks, oranges, and yellows. Grassy banks line the meandering waterway, creating a natural pathway that draws the eye from foreground to the distant peaks. The painting embodies its title perfectly, juxtaposing the eternal evergreens with the transitional autumn colors in a single harmonious landscape.

## 2. Palette
Liquid Black provides the foundation for this warm, transitional scene. The dramatic sky uses Alizarin Crimson, Bright Red, Cadmium Yellow, and Indian Yellow to create the glowing sunset atmosphere. Snow-capped mountains are sculpted with Titanium White highlighted against shadows of Phthalo Blue and Prussian Blue. The evergreen conifers combine Midnight Black, Prussian Blue, and Sap Green for deep, rich foliage. Autumn trees on the right showcase Cadmium Yellow, Indian Yellow, and Yellow Ochre for their golden seasonal display. Van Dyke Brown and Dark Sienna form the earthy banks and understory, while the stream reflects the sky's blues and whites. This palette captures the transitional moment between seasons with warm atmospheric tones balanced against cool mountain shadows.

## 3. Mood & Atmosphere
The atmosphere radiates warmth and peaceful transition, capturing that liminal moment when seasons shift. The glowing sunset sky bathes the entire scene in golden-pink light, creating a sense of time suspended between day and night, summer and winter. The warm tones dominate despite the snow-capped peaks, suggesting the lingering warmth of autumn even as winter approaches the high country. The mood is contemplative and serene, celebrating nature's eternal cycles of change while honoring the constants—the steadfast evergreens and enduring mountains. The dramatic sky provides emotional weight without creating tension, instead offering a gentle reminder of nature's beautiful impermanence.

Lighting: **Warm Sunset Glow**

## 4. Structural Layout
The left foreground features tall, dark evergreen conifers that frame the scene and create strong vertical elements. The right side showcases deciduous trees with golden autumn foliage, providing a warmer, softer contrast to the evergreens. The center is dominated by the snow-capped mountain range in the background, serving as the focal point and anchoring the composition. A winding stream flows from the middle ground toward the foreground, creating a natural S-curve that leads the viewer's eye into the scene. Grassy banks line both sides of the waterway in the foreground. The background mountains establish clear atmospheric perspective, while the middle ground transitions from water to vegetation. The layering creates distinct planes: foreground stream and banks, middle ground valley floor, and background mountain peaks beneath the expansive, glowing sky.

## 5. Motion
The stream flows actively from the middle ground forward, its meandering path creating an S-curve that generates dynamic movement through the composition. Small ripples and highlights suggest gentle current over rocks and shallows. The sky shows soft gradations from warm pinks and oranges at the horizon to yellows higher up, implying the subtle movement of atmospheric light during sunset. The compositional flow follows the water's journey, drawing the viewer's eye from the foreground stream back through the valley toward the distant peaks. The contrast between the static, vertical evergreens and the horizontal, flowing water creates visual tension and balance. Wind-swept branches on the left conifers suggest a gentle breeze, adding subtle animation to the otherwise peaceful scene.

## 6. Technique
The initial canvas treatment uses Liquid Black as a foundation, allowing the warm sky colors to glow through. The dramatic sunset sky employs wet-on-wet blending techniques, crisscrossing Alizarin Crimson, Bright Red, Cadmium Yellow, and Indian Yellow to create smooth gradations. Mountains are sculpted with the knife, pulling Titanium White in bold strokes for snow-covered peaks, then adding Phthalo Blue and Prussian Blue for shadows and contours. The evergreen conifers are created with fan brush techniques, using a mixture of Midnight Black, Prussian Blue, and Sap Green, with limbs pulled downward in characteristic sweeping motions. Autumn trees on the right use a stippling or tapping technique with yellows and ochres to create the illusion of golden foliage. The stream is painted with horizontal knife strokes and liquid white techniques, creating smooth water flow with strategic highlights for ripples. Grassy banks use Van Dyke Brown and Dark Sienna with vertical upward strokes for texture, highlighted with yellows and greens where light catches the vegetation.

## 7. Narrative Layer
"This is a landscape caught in the eternal dance between constancy and change—where evergreens stand as timeless sentinels while their deciduous neighbors transform in brilliant autumn gold. The snow already claiming the mountain peaks promises winter's arrival, yet the warm, glowing sky speaks of autumn's lingering embrace, reluctant to yield. The stream flows on, indifferent to seasons, its journey as constant as the mountains themselves, reminding us that nature's rhythms continue whether we mark them or not."

## 8. Initial Canvas Treatment
The canvas receives a complete coat of Liquid Black, providing a dark, wet foundation that allows the warm sunset colors to glow with exceptional vibrancy. This black base creates dramatic contrast for the bright sky and ensures that the dark evergreens maintain their depth and richness. The wet-on-wet technique begins immediately with the sky applied over the liquid black, pushing the warm colors across the upper canvas while leaving strategic areas darker for atmospheric depth. This foundation treatment enables smooth blending in the sky, luminous highlights on the water, and helps the seasonal contrast between dark evergreens and bright autumn foliage achieve maximum visual impact.
