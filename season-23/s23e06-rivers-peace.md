## 7. Narrative Layer
"In the hush before the storm, the river holds its ancient peace. The birch trees stand as pale sentinels, their weathered forms bearing witness to countless seasons of change while the dark waters flow eternal beneath gathering clouds. Here, in this threshold moment between autumn's fade and winter's approach, solitude becomes sanctuary, and the quiet strength of nature's cycles offers its own profound comfort."

## 8. Initial Canvas Treatment
- Dark base coat covering entire canvas in Midnight Black and Prussian Blue blend
- Thinned with liquid medium for smooth, even application
- Creates dramatic foundation that shows through final composition
- Establishes moody value structure from the start
The dark foundation provides the stormy, contemplative atmosphere that defines the entire painting's emotional character.
