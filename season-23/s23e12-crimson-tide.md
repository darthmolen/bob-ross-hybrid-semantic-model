## 4. Structural Layout
- Left: Dark silhouetted promontory with evergreens creates strong vertical anchor
- Right: Open vista of sky and sea extends to the horizon
- Center: Transition zone where turbulent sky meets churning ocean
- Foreground: Detailed wave action with pronounced highlights and shadows
- Midground: Rolling swells create rhythmic patterns across the water
- Background: Sky dominates with dramatic cloud formations in crimson and purple
- Depth style: **Atmospheric perspective through silhouette contrast**

## 5. Motion
- Waves surge forward with powerful rolling motion toward the viewer
- Cloud formations sweep across the sky with wind-driven energy
- Foam and spray suggest continuous churning action
- Diagonal wave patterns create dynamic visual flow from left to right
- Motion profile: **Surging oceanic turbulence**

## 6. Technique
- Palette knife work for bold wave structures and highlights
- Fan brush for foaming wave crests and spray effects
- Large brush for sweeping cloud formations in the dramatic sky
- Vertical strokes for distant wave patterns
- Silhouette technique with dark values against lighter sky
- Wet-on-wet blending for atmospheric gradations in clouds
- Signature technique: **Bold knife-sculpted waves with crimson-washed atmosphere**

## 7. Narrative Layer
"A violent beauty unfolds where ocean meets tempest under a sky washed in crimson and violet. The solitary cliff stands as eternal witness to the sea's perpetual dance with storm, its dark trees bending in winds that churn the waters below. This is nature's theater at its most dramatic—where light struggles against shadow, calm against chaos, and the viewer stands at the threshold of elemental forces beyond human scale. The crimson tide suggests not just the color of sky reflected in sea, but the lifeblood of nature itself in constant, magnificent upheaval."

## 8. Initial Canvas Treatment
- Canvas prepared with dark purple and blue wet base across entire surface
- Darker values concentrated in areas designated for ocean and cliff silhouette
- Lighter purple-crimson blend in sky areas to facilitate dramatic cloud work
- The dark foundation allows brilliant highlights to emerge with maximum contrast.
