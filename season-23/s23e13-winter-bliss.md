## 7. Narrative Layer
"In the high country where winter reigns supreme, the mountains catch the last whispers of daylight in a display of rose and lavender splendor. A lone bare tree stands as sentinel beside the frozen lake, bearing witness to the eternal dance between light and shadow across the snowy peaks. This is the moment of perfect stillness, when the cold alpine air holds its breath and the world becomes a sanctuary of winter bliss, where time seems to pause in reverence of nature's quiet magnificence."

## 8. Initial Canvas Treatment
- Black canvas preparation creating the dramatic oval vignette frame
- Likely dark base coat applied around the oval opening to establish the window effect
- Sky area treated with Titanium White and color wet-on-wet for soft blending
- Initial washes of blue and purple establishing atmospheric foundation
The oval format foundation creates an intimate portal framing the alpine vista.
