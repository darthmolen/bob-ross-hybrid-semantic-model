- Depth style: **Layered vertical descent**

## 5. Motion
- Strong vertical motion of the waterfall creating downward flow
- Horizontal stream movement in the foreground drawing the eye into the scene
- Cascading water suggests continuous powerful movement
- Implied wind movement in the stormy sky
- Rapids and whitewater indicate turbulent flow over rocks
- Motion profile: **Vertical cascade with forward stream flow**

## 6. Technique
- Fan brush creates the smooth, flowing waterfall effect with vertical strokes
- Palette knife work highlights the grassy slopes with upward strokes
- Wet-on-wet blending in the dark sky for atmospheric depth
- Liner brush details the evergreen trees along the ridgelines
- Knife technique creates texture in the foreground rocks
- Phthalo Blue pulled down with fan brush for water transparency
- Highlighting technique on grass using knife-edge application
- Signature technique: **Vertical fan brush waterfall with knife-highlighted slopes**

## 7. Narrative Layer
"Deep within an untouched mountain valley, a powerful waterfall descends from storm-darkened heights, its waters catching what little light penetrates the brooding sky. The vibrant green slopes stand as testament to the life-giving force of these waters, their luminous quality suggesting brief sunlight breaking through heavy clouds. This is a place where nature's raw power and serene beauty coexist, where the thunder of falling water echoes off ancient stone, and where the verdant earth drinks deeply from the mountain's gift."

## 8. Initial Canvas Treatment
- Dark base coat applied across the entire canvas for the moody foundation
- Prussian Blue and black mixture blended wet into the upper portions for the stormy sky
- Darker values in the center channel where the waterfall will descend
- Wet surface maintained for blending the atmospheric background mountains
- The dark foundation allows the bright greens to pop with dramatic contrast.
