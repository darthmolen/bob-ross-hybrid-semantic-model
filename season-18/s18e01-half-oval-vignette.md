## 7. Narrative Layer

"An elegant window into a pristine mountain wilderness, where tall evergreens stand guard over a mirror-calm lake. The soft purple mountains dissolve into atmospheric mist, while golden bushes catch the gentle light. The half-oval frame creates an intimate, almost dreamlike portal to this peaceful sanctuary, inviting quiet contemplation of nature's serene beauty."

## 8. Initial Canvas Treatment

- **Liquid White base**: Applied across the canvas for wet-on-wet blending
- **Contact paper vignette**: Half-oval template masked the painting area, creating the distinctive arched frame
- **Dark vignette edges**: The surrounding area left dark or painted black to emphasize the framed composition
- **Smooth preparation**: Even coverage for sky and water blending
- **No texture**: Standard smooth surface for traditional techniques
