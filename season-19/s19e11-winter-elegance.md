- Smooth horizontal strokes for snow surface
- Liner brush for delicate branch details and twigs
- Gentle feathering to create misty background
- Scraping or scratching for fine branch details
- Layered application for depth in tree placement

## 7. Narrative Layer

"An elegant winter evening where bare trees stand as silent sentinels beneath a sky ablaze with color. The warm glow suggests the last light of day, while the cool snow creates a peaceful, contemplative atmosphere. The graceful bare branches reach upward, celebrating the stark beauty of winter's quiet season."

## 8. Initial Canvas Treatment

- Likely Liquid White or Liquid Clear base for sky blending
- Possibly pre-blended sky colors before tree application
- No dark gesso underpainting
- No contact paper masking
- Smooth canvas preparation for seamless sky gradients
- Foundation prepared for wet-on-wet blending technique

A foundational approach emphasizing smooth color transitions and atmospheric depth for a luminous winter sky scene.
