# Season 19, Episode 9 — "Ebb Tide" (1989)

## 1. Composition

- Pure oceanscape with no land visible
- Dramatic breaking wave with white foam crest in foreground
- Dark purple-blue ocean water with rolling swells
- Expansive sunset sky filling upper two-thirds
- Layered clouds with warm orange and yellow tones
- Horizontal bands of purple and lavender in clouds
- Clear horizon line dividing ocean from sky
- Beach/shoreline suggested in immediate foreground
- No structures or vegetation

A dramatic oceanscape composition featuring a crashing wave beneath a vibrant sunset sky.

## 2. Palette

- Warm sunset tones: bright oranges, yellows, peachy hues
- Cool contrast: deep purples, violets, and blues in water and clouds
- Titanium White for wave foam and cloud highlights
- Dark values: Prussian Blue, Phthalo Blue for ocean depths
- Alizarin Crimson for purple-lavender cloud layers
- Cadmium Yellow and Indian Yellow for sunset glow
- High contrast between warm sky and cool ocean
- Complementary orange-purple color relationship

Palette identity: **Warm Sunset Radiance Over Cool Violet Ocean**

## 3. Mood & Atmosphere

- Dramatic and powerful
- Serene yet energetic
- Contemplative ocean meditation
- Warmth of fading daylight
- Natural rhythm of tides
- Peaceful grandeur
- Emotional pull between calm sky and active water

Lighting: **diffuse sunset glow** creating warm atmospheric radiance above dynamic ocean movement.

## 4. Structural Layout

- **Left:** Purple-tinted cloud formations, dark ocean water
- **Right:** Orange-yellow sunset intensity, continuing wave patterns
- **Center:** Primary breaking wave with white foam crest, horizon line
- **Foreground:** Crashing wave with detailed foam texture, dark wet beach
- **Midground:** Rolling ocean swells with purple-blue tones
- **Background:** Layered sunset clouds with warm-to-cool gradient

Depth style: **layered horizontal planes** with strong atmospheric color separation between sky zones and ocean.

## 5. Motion

- Breaking wave motion with foam cascading forward
- Ocean swells rolling toward shore
- Implied tidal movement (ebb tide receding)
- Horizontal cloud drift from left to right
- Foam streaks and water texture suggesting turbulence
- Compositional flow: wave draws eye to center, sky pulls upward

Motion profile: **Dynamic Wave Action with Horizontal Atmospheric Flow**

## 6. Technique

- Liquid White or Liquid Clear base for sky blending
- Large brush circular and criss-cross blending for clouds
- Fan brush for ocean water texture and wave patterns
- Palette knife for white foam highlights and wave crest
- Horizontal blending strokes for cloud layers
- Push-and-pull technique for wave volume
- Stippling or dabbing for foam texture
- Dark underpainting showing through for ocean depth

Signature technique: **palette knife foam highlights** creating dimensional wave structure over blended ocean tones.

## 7. Narrative Layer

"The ebb tide retreats as the sun sets over an endless ocean, leaving behind a final dramatic wave that crashes against the shore. The warm golden sky contrasts with the cool, powerful waters below, capturing the eternal rhythm of the sea. A moment of natural grandeur where day transitions to evening and the ocean reveals both its beauty and its force."

## 8. Initial Canvas Treatment

- Liquid White applied across entire canvas
- Possibly heavier application in sky for extended blending time
- Wet-on-wet foundation for smooth color transitions
- No masking or contact paper
- No dark gesso underpainting
- Even coating to allow fluid sky work and ocean textures

A foundational wet-surface approach emphasizing smooth gradients in the sunset sky and fluid ocean movements.
