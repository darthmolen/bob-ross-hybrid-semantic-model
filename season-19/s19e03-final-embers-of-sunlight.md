## 7. Narrative Layer

"The final embers of sunlight blaze across the horizon, painting the sky in brilliant warm hues as day surrenders to night. Dark sentinel trees frame this luminous moment, their silhouettes creating a natural cathedral through which the last rays of sun stream toward the viewer. The reflective pathway invites contemplation of this fleeting transition, capturing the peaceful majesty of sunset's final gift—a reminder that endings can be beautiful."

## 8. Initial Canvas Treatment

- **Oval canvas format**: Pre-shaped or masked oval composition
- **Dark base tones**: Initial dark application for silhouette areas
- **Liquid White or Liquid Clear**: Applied to sky area for smooth blending
- **Strategic layering**: Dark foundation with luminous overlay
- **No contact paper masking**: Organic edge work
- **Gradated preparation**: Possible pre-blending of warm tones

A dramatic oval-format foundation emphasizing the interplay between radiant light and deep shadows, designed to showcase the luminous sunset against dark framing elements.
