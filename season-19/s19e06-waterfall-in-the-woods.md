## 7. Narrative Layer

"A hidden waterfall plunges through a narrow rocky gorge, its brilliant white cascade contrasting against ancient dark cliffs adorned with luminous green moss. The secluded canyon creates an intimate, powerful space where water and stone have coexisted for ages. The deep pool at the base captures the waterfall's energy in a moment of stillness before continuing its journey through the woods."

## 8. Initial Canvas Treatment

- Dark toned canvas (Liquid Black or black gesso base)
- Possibly Liquid Clear in waterfall area for transparency effects
- No contact paper masking
- No textured gesso
- Dark foundation allows for dramatic light contrasts
