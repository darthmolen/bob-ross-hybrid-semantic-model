- Sky gradations imply the gentle transition of sunset
- Palm fronds suggest tropical breeze despite their silhouetted stillness

Motion profile: **Dynamic wave action**

## 6. Technique
- Bold knife work creates sharp, brilliant white highlights on wave crests and foam
- Wet-on-wet blending produces smooth sky transitions from yellow to lavender
- Fan brush technique forms delicate palm fronds in silhouette
- Liquid horizontal strokes build the wave's rolling motion and depth
- Careful layering of blues creates dimensional ocean depth
- Push-pull technique suggests wave translucency and internal light
- Firm knife pressure for beach texture and wave definition

Signature technique: **Knife-worked wave highlights with translucent depth**

## 7. Narrative Layer
"Beneath a blazing tropical sunset, the ocean performs its eternal dance, sending powerful waves rolling toward a palm-lined shore. The silhouetted palms stand as dark witnesses to this daily spectacle, where warm skies meet cool waters in perfect harmony. This is a moment of tropical paradise frozen in time—the peaceful coexistence of nature's gentle beauty and untamed power, where every wave tells a story of distant horizons and endless motion."

## 8. Initial Canvas Treatment
- Canvas likely began with **Liquid White** or **Liquid Clear** base for smooth blending
- Pre-applied horizontal color bands for sunset (yellow, orange, lavender)
- Wet surface allowed for seamless sky-to-water transitions
- Base coat enabled the wet-on-wet technique essential for atmospheric blending

The canvas received a liquid base with pre-mixed sunset colors, creating a luminous foundation for building tropical atmosphere.
