## 7. Narrative Layer
"A hidden mountain lake discovered at the peak of autumn's glory, framed as though glimpsed through a window in time. The warm golden light filters through lifting mist, illuminating the blazing deciduous trees while dark evergreens stand sentinel. This is a moment of perfect seasonal transition, caught in the intimate focus of the oval frame—a private meditation on autumn's fleeting beauty in the high wilderness."

## 8. Initial Canvas Treatment
- Likely prepared with Liquid White to support the warm, glowing luminosity
- Warm golden undertone established across the oval working area
- Soft blending foundation allowing atmospheric mist effects
- Initial dark values blocked in for evergreen mass

The warm-toned base enables the characteristic golden glow and seamless atmospheric transitions throughout the oval composition.
