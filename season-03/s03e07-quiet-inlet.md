## 7. Narrative Layer
"Here lies a secret inlet where the world grows quiet and the water forgets how to move. Purple mountains stand sentinel in the mist, eternal guardians of this hidden sanctuary. The warm light filters through as if blessing this place, turning every leaf into captured sunshine. This is where solitude becomes communion with something greater than loneliness."

## 8. Initial Canvas Treatment
- Canvas coated with liquid white or liquid clear for maximum luminosity
- Bright foundation allows for transparent color layering and soft blending
- Sky area likely pre-worked with warm yellows and whites while wet
- Generous wet medium ensures smooth mountain transitions and atmospheric effects
The ultra-bright liquid base creates the signature high-key, glowing quality that suffuses this peaceful inlet scene.
