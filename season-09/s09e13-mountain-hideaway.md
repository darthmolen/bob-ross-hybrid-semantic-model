# Season 9, Episode 13 — "Mountain Hideaway" (1985)

## 1. Composition

- **Landforms**: Snow-capped mountain peaks with blue-purple shadows rising in the distant background, rolling green hills in midground
- **Water features**: Cascading waterfall in lower left foreground, flowing stream with white water highlights, rocky stream bed
- **Trees and vegetation**: Dark evergreen trees (spruce/pine) creating dramatic silhouettes on both left and right edges, vibrant lime-green and yellow-green grassy foliage in foreground and midground, scattered background evergreens
- **Sky conditions**: Brilliant blue sky with white billowing clouds, magnificent rainbow arching across the entire valley from left to right
- **Structures**: None
- **Overall compositional archetype**: Rainbow valley vista with evergreen gateway frame

A spectacular **oval-framed mountain sanctuary** composition where dark evergreen trees create natural borders around a hidden valley crowned by a luminous rainbow spanning the mountain peaks.

## 2. Palette

- **Primary colors used**: Prussian Blue, Phthalo Blue, Titanium White, Midnight Black, Sap Green, Cadmium Yellow, Yellow Ochre, Van Dyke Brown, Dark Sienna, Alizarin Crimson (in rainbow), Indian Yellow
- **Warm vs cool**: Balanced with cool blue sky and mountains contrasting against warm vibrant greens and yellows in foreground vegetation
- **High-contrast vs low-contrast**: Extremely high contrast between dark black evergreen silhouettes and bright rainbow-lit sky, vibrant green highlights against darker shadows
- **Signature color relationships**: Rainbow spectrum against blue sky, brilliant lime greens against dark tree silhouettes, white water against earth-toned rocks, purple-blue mountains against bright clouds

Palette identity: **rainbow-illuminated spring palette with vibrant electric greens and full spectrum brilliance**

## 3. Mood & Atmosphere

- Magical and enchanting wonder
- Hopeful and uplifting spirit
- Fresh post-storm renewal
- Cheerful brightness and optimism
- Hidden sanctuary of natural beauty

Lighting: **rainbow light with post-storm brilliance** creating a magical quality where spectrum colors arch across bright blue sky above a sun-drenched mountain valley.

## 4. Structural Layout

- **Left**: Tall dark evergreen tree silhouettes with bright lime-green foliage at base, waterfall cascading over rocks
- **Right**: Matching evergreen silhouettes with yellow-green highlighted foliage creating frame
- **Center**: Magnificent rainbow arc spanning the valley, snow-capped mountain peaks beneath, white clouds
- **Foreground**: Rocky stream bed with white water cascading and flowing, vibrant green grassy banks with earth-toned highlights
- **Midground**: Rolling hills covered in bright green grass, scattered evergreen trees creating depth
- **Background**: Purple-blue mountain peaks with snow caps, brilliant blue sky with white clouds

Depth style: **dramatic layered depth with rainbow arc creating spatial dimension and oval framing intensifying focus**

## 5. Motion

- Waterfall actively cascading down rocky face
- Stream water flowing and tumbling over rocks
- Rainbow statically arching in eternal stillness
- Otherwise calm and peaceful atmosphere
- Eye flows from dark foreground trees through rainbow arc to distant peaks
- Vertical emphasis from evergreens and waterfall
- Gentle upward movement suggested by rainbow's arc

Motion profile: **cascading water flow in otherwise serene rainbow-crowned valley**

## 6. Technique

- Liquid White base for bright, blendable foundation
- Prussian Blue and Phthalo Blue blended for sky with titanium white clouds
- Rainbow created with soft horizontal strokes blending full spectrum (red, orange, yellow, green, blue, violet)
- Palette knife for angular mountain peaks and snow highlights
- Fan brush for dark evergreen silhouettes with quick upward strokes
- Fan brush and palette knife for vibrant green foliage with heavy Cadmium Yellow and Sap Green highlights
- Pulling down technique for waterfall using Titanium White
- Liner brush for fine tree branches and water ripples
- Van Dyke Brown and Dark Sienna for rocky stream bed
- Heavy impasto white for water highlights and foam
- Atmospheric purple-blue for distant mountains

Signature technique: **rainbow arc blending with cascading waterfall and electric fan brush foliage creating magical contrast**

## 7. Narrative Layer

"Through a natural gateway of evergreen sentinels, a hidden mountain valley reveals its secret glory—a magnificent rainbow arching across snow-capped peaks, blessing the sanctuary below. A waterfall tumbles over ancient rocks while vibrant green meadows roll toward distant mountains, and nature paints her promise across the sky in brilliant spectrum light. This is a place where magic lives, where storms give way to wonder, and where the mountains keep their rainbow safe."

## 8. Initial Canvas Treatment

- Liquid White applied across entire canvas for bright blendable base
- Possibly with light blue undertones pre-blended for sky foundation
- Bright wet surface allowing rainbow and sky blending
- No dark underpainting needed for this luminous scene
- No contact paper or masking
- Wet foundation enables vibrant color saturation and smooth transitions

A bright, wet foundation creating the perfect surface for rainbow blending and allowing vibrant greens and blues to achieve maximum brilliance and magical luminosity.
