- Knife work for tree trunks and cabin structure
- Edge highlighting on trees to show backlighting effect
- Pull-down reflections in water with vertical strokes
- Liner brush for fine branches and grasses
- Layering technique: dark shapes over brilliant background
- Minimal blending in certain areas to preserve color intensity

Signature technique: **explosive sunset color application with dramatic backlighting and perfect water reflection technique**

## 7. Narrative Layer

"A brilliant red sunset blazes across the sky, painting the world in shades of crimson, orange, and gold. Tall evergreens stand as silent sentinels, their edges kissed by the dying light, while a humble cabin offers refuge in this wilderness cathedral. The still water becomes a perfect mirror, doubling the spectacular display as nature performs its most dramatic daily ritual. This is a moment of profound peace, where a solitary soul might pause to witness the glory of day's end, grateful for beauty that asks nothing but to be observed."

## 8. Initial Canvas Treatment

- Likely Liquid White or Liquid Clear for smooth blending in sky area
- Possible darker base coat in certain areas for cloud contrast
- Traditional wet-on-wet foundation allowing color manipulation
- No contact paper masking
