## 5. Motion

- Rainbow arcing gracefully across the sky

Motion profile: **serene stillness with rainbow's arcing gesture**

## 6. Technique

- Liquid White base for smooth blending
- Knife work for mountain peaks with blue-white mixtures
- Fan brush for delicate rainbow with light pressure
- One-inch brush for evergreens using downward pulling strokes
- Fan brush for bright foliage using pushing and tapping motions
- Palette knife for rocky foreground elements
- Liner brush for tree trunks and fine branches
- Horizontal blending for water reflections
- Highlighting with pure white on snow peaks and water shimmer

Signature technique: **delicate rainbow application over knife-painted mountain peaks**

## 7. Narrative Layer

"In the forest hills where spring arrives beneath towering mountains, a rainbow appears as nature's blessing over pristine waters. The bright yellow-green of new growth celebrates renewal against the ancient evergreens and eternal snow peaks. Bob Ross captures a moment of perfect harmony—where earth meets sky, winter meets spring, and stillness meets wonder. This is painting as meditation on nature's cycles and the joy found in her most magical moments."

## 8. Initial Canvas Treatment
