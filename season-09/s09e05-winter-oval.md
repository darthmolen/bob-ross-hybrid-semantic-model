## 5. Motion

- Static, peaceful composition with minimal motion

- Compositional flow: eye drawn to center mountain peaks, then guided by tree clusters to cabin detail, oval frame contains and returns viewer's gaze

Motion profile: **静止 tranquility with subtle atmospheric drift**

## 6. Technique

- Oval masking technique using contact paper or similar material to create vignette border
- Liquid White base for smooth blending
- Fan brush for evergreen trees using upward tapping motions
- Purple mountain peaks created with Alizarin Crimson and white blends
- Palette knife for snow texture and highlights
- Horizontal blending strokes for cloud layers
- Fine liner brush for cabin details and window glow
- Soft blending at oval edges to create gradual fade
- Stippling or pushing technique for snow texture in foreground

Signature technique: **oval vignette masking with wet-on-wet purple atmospheric blending**

## 7. Narrative Layer

"A peaceful winter sanctuary framed within an elegant oval, where purple mountains rise majestically above a snow-blanketed valley. The dark evergreens stand as silent sentinels around a humble cabin whose warm glowing window promises refuge from the cold. The oval frame creates an intimate viewing portal, as if we're peering through a frosted window into this tranquil winter world. Bob Ross invites us to find beauty in simplicity and warmth in the coldest season."

## 8. Initial Canvas Treatment

- Liquid White applied across entire canvas
- Oval mask applied with contact paper or masking material before painting
- Smooth wet surface for blending capability
- No dark underpainting
