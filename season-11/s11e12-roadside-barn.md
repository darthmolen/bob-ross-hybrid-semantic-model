## 7. Narrative Layer
"Along a quiet country road, an old red barn stands as a testament to simpler times, framed by the golden splendor of autumn and the ghostly white sentinels of birch trees. The misty hills beyond blur into memory, while the barn remains vivid and real—a reminder that some things endure even as seasons change. This is a place where time slows, where the rustle of leaves and the trickle of water speak of peace and permanence."

## 8. Initial Canvas Treatment
- **Base**: Liquid White application for wet-on-wet blending capability
- **Coverage**: Thin, even coating across entire canvas
- **Purpose**: Enables soft atmospheric blending in sky and misty background while allowing sharp details in foreground

Canvas prepared with Liquid White for seamless atmospheric transitions and luminous autumn highlights.
