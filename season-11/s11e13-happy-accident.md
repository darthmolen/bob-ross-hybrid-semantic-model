## 7. Narrative Layer
"A forest stands witness to autumn's transformation beneath an almost supernatural sky, where colors dance like northern lights above the canopy. The stark dead tree reaches upward as a reminder of nature's cycles, standing sentinel over the vibrant living forest below. In this 'happy accident,' the boundary between earth and sky blurs into a dreamscape where reality and imagination intertwine, celebrating both life's brilliance and its inevitable passage through seasons of change."
