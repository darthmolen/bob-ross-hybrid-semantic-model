## 7. Narrative Layer
"A weathered barn stands resolute against the winter cold, its dark walls a stark contrast to the blanket of fresh snow. The winding path suggests recent passage, perhaps a farmer's morning rounds, while the soft pink sky hints at either dawn's promise or dusk's quiet farewell. This is a place of humble endurance, where simple structures and nature exist in quiet harmony through the long winter months."

## 8. Initial Canvas Treatment

- Possible pre-blending of cool tones in sky area
- Smooth preparation enables seamless wet-on-wet technique
- Thin, consistent coverage allows for maximum blending
