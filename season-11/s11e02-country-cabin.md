## 7. Narrative Layer
"A humble log cabin stands as a testament to self-sufficiency and simple living, nestled in a snow-blanketed clearing where the forest meets the sky. The soft pink glow suggests either the promise of a new winter day or the peaceful close of an evening, while the surrounding evergreens stand as silent guardians. This is a place where one might escape the complexity of modern life, finding solace in the essential beauty of wood, snow, and stillness."

## 8. Initial Canvas Treatment
- Canvas prepared with Liquid White for smooth wet-on-wet blending
- Allowed sky colors to glide and merge seamlessly
- White base enabling the bright, luminous quality of fresh snow
- Thin, even application supporting both dark and light value ranges

The Liquid White foundation creates the perfect surface for blending the cool blues with warm crimson tones while maintaining brilliant snow highlights.
