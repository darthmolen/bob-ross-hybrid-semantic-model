## 7. Narrative Layer
"A winter sanctuary emerges from the mist like a cherished memory, the oval barn standing as testament to rural endurance and simple shelter. Bare birches reach skyward as silent witnesses while the frozen stream traces a path to warmth and refuge. This is not merely a building in snow, but a portal to quieter times, where the cold world outside makes the promise of shelter within all the more precious."

## 8. Initial Canvas Treatment
- Base coat of **Liquid White** or **Liquid Clear** enables smooth wet-on-wet blending
- Blue tones likely applied early for sky establishment
- Oval shape created through careful masking or freehand technique
- Canvas remains workable throughout for seamless atmospheric transitions
The oval vignette base allows soft edge feathering and creates the painting's distinctive cameo presentation.
