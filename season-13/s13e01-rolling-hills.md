- **Liner brush**: Fine tree trunks, branches, and delicate details on cabin and grasses
- **Atmospheric blending**: Graduated color transitions creating misty depth in mountain layers
- **Reflection technique**: Downward vertical strokes creating mirror images in water
- **Layering**: Multiple mountain ranges built with progressively lighter, cooler tones
- **Soft edges**: Blurred boundaries on distant mountains enhancing atmospheric perspective

Signature technique: **Layered Atmospheric Mountain Ranges with Perfect Lake Reflections**

## 7. Narrative Layer
"Where rolling hills embrace a mirror lake, autumn and spring dance together in timeless harmony beneath a glowing sunset sky. The distant mountains fade into purple dreams, their layered silhouettes whispering stories of depth and distance, while the water holds every reflection with perfect clarity. A small cabin rests quietly among the trees, bearing witness to this serene meeting of warm earth and cool sky, where seasons blend and peace settles like the valley mist."

## 8. Initial Canvas Treatment
- Canvas prepared with **Liquid White** to create smooth, wet surface for seamless blending
- Even coverage enabling wet-on-wet technique throughout the painting
- The treatment allows warm sunset colors to glow with luminosity
- Facilitates soft atmospheric transitions in the layered mountains
- Enables perfect reflection technique in the still water surface
- Creates the foundation for the painting's ethereal, blended quality

The Liquid White base provides the essential foundation for this tranquil, atmospherically rich landscape.
