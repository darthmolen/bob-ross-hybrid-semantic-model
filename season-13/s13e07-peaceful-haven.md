## 7. Narrative Layer
"Here lies a haven where the world's noise fades to whisper, where a humble cabin keeps watch over waters so still they mirror heaven itself. Golden autumn trees stand sentinel beside the weathered walls, while dark evergreens shelter this quiet place from time's relentless passage. The mountains beyond rise in soft majesty, their ancient presence a reminder that peace is not the absence of grandeur, but the perfect harmony between wild nature and the human heart's need for sanctuary."

- Uniform coverage enabling smooth wet-on-wet blending for sky and water
- The Liquid White provides luminosity beneath the water reflections and atmospheric elements
- Allows for seamless color transitions in the warm sky and soft mountain haze
- Facilitates the mirror-like quality of the calm lake surface

The traditional Liquid White base creates the perfect foundation for this luminous, tranquil scene with its characteristic reflective water and soft atmospheric blending.
