## 7. Narrative Layer
"Through nature's own window, framed by towering evergreens and spring-bright foliage, a majestic snow-capped mountain rises in solitary splendor above a tranquil lake. A winding path beckons from shadowed foreground into sun-warmed meadows, inviting the viewer to journey toward that pristine wilderness sanctuary. The sunset sky blushes pink and coral, blessing the scene with gentle warmth, while the mountain stands eternal and serene—a testament to nature's grand architecture glimpsed through this perfect circular portal of peace."

## 8. Initial Canvas Treatment
- Canvas prepared with **Liquid White** creating smooth, wet surface for seamless blending
- Even base coverage enabling wet-on-wet technique throughout the painting
- Additional darker underpainting likely applied around the edges to establish circular vignette structure
- The Liquid White treatment allows sunset colors to glow with luminosity in the sky
- Facilitates soft atmospheric transitions from warm sky to cool mountain tones
- Enables smooth blending of the bright green spring foliage and dark evergreen shadows
- Creates the foundation for the dramatic light-to-dark radial composition

The Liquid White base with strategic dark underpainting provides the essential foundation for this distinctive circular vignette mountain landscape.
