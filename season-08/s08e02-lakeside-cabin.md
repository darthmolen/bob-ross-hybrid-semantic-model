"A weathered cabin stands in quiet communion with the changing seasons, its dark form reflected in the glassy lake while morning mist weaves between evergreen sentinels and golden autumn trees. The oval window into this scene captures a moment of perfect stillness, where time seems suspended in the soft light of an autumn dawn. Here is a place of solitude and gentle beauty, where nature's transitions unfold in harmonious balance."

## 8. Initial Canvas Treatment
- Likely wet white or pale blue base for sky area
- Pre-applied liquid white or clear medium for blending capacity
- Even foundation allowing smooth transitions
- Oval mask or border technique applied before or after painting
The foundation supports seamless atmospheric blending and the soft vignette edge treatment.
