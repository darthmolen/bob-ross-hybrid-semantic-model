"A solitary cabin stands inhabited in the winter wilderness, its glowing windows promising warmth against the cold expanse. The seasonal crossroads is visible in autumn trees persisting behind fresh snowfall, suggesting the retreat's occupant witnesses nature's transition. The scene captures the duality of winter isolation—both the quietude of separation and the comfort of sheltered refuge."

## 8. Initial Canvas Treatment
