"A remote alpine sanctuary rises from perfectly still waters, where spring vegetation meets eternal snow. The pink-washed sky suggests the liminal hour of dawn or dusk, when the mountains stand in silent witness to the changing light. This is a place untouched by time, where nature's grandeur and delicate beauty exist in perfect harmony."

## 8. Initial Canvas Treatment

- **Liquid white or clear base** on lower canvas for wet-on-wet water technique
- **Possible dark undertone** in water area to enhance depth and reflection contrast
- Wet canvas throughout to allow smooth blending and reflection techniques

Foundation emphasizes soft atmospheric quality with preparation for both mountain drama and water serenity.
