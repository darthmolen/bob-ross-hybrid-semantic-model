## 4. Structural Layout

- **Left:** Towering rocky mountain formations with dramatic yellow and brown striations
- **Right:** Tall saguaro cactus sentinel, smaller cacti, open desert vista
- **Center:** Sandy pathway drawing eye into middle ground, green vegetation cluster
- **Foreground:** Desert floor with sandy path, small barrel cactus, scattered rocks
- **Midground:** Lush green desert grasses, additional cacti, vegetation clusters
- **Background:** Layered purple mountain range, soft cloudy sky

Depth style: **layered atmospheric planes** with warm-to-cool color recession creating desert expanse.

- Delicate liner brush details for cactus spines and arms
- Soft blending for purple mountain atmospheric fade
- Push-up technique for desert grasses and vegetation
- Horizontal blending for sky gradation
- Stippling and tapping for desert floor texture
- Light feathering for cloud formations

Signature technique: **bold knife-worked rock formations contrasted with delicate cactus detail work**
