## 1. Composition

- **Waterfall**: Dramatic multi-tiered cascade flowing down the center from towering rock formations
- **Rock formations**: Massive, misty cliffs and boulders dominating the upper canvas
- **Trees and vegetation**: Tall evergreens framing both left and right sides, soft foliage clusters on rocks
- **Water features**: Foreground lake or pool receiving the waterfall, calm reflective surface
- **Sky conditions**: Soft, misty atmosphere with subtle light filtering through
- **Atmospheric effects**: Heavy mist rising from the base of the falls, creating ethereal depth
- **Human element**: Small figures at the water's edge in the foreground, providing scale
- **Overall compositional archetype**: Vertical waterfall monument with mist-shrouded rocks

A towering waterfall composition with dramatic vertical emphasis and atmospheric depth through layered mist.

## 2. Palette

- **Rock tones**: Prussian Blue and Midnight Black mixed for cool, shadowed stone faces
- **Highlights**: Titanium White for waterfall foam and misty atmospheric glow
- **Warm accents**: Van Dyke Brown, Dark Sienna, and Yellow Ochre for rock warmth and variety
- **Foliage**: Sap Green for evergreens and moss-covered rocks
- **Color temperature**: Cool-dominant with strategic warm earth tones in rocks
- **Atmospheric tones**: Soft grays and blues create misty recession
- **Red accents**: Alizarin Crimson and Bright Red likely used for small human figures or subtle warm touches
- **Yellow notes**: Indian Yellow and Cadmium Yellow for atmospheric glow and highlights

Palette identity: **Cool Misty Monumentality with Earth-Warmed Stone**

## 3. Mood & Atmosphere

- **Tone**: Majestic and serene
- **Emotional quality**: Awe-inspiring yet peaceful
- **Atmospheric density**: Heavy mist creates mystery and grandeur
- **Scale**: The tiny human figures emphasize the waterfall's overwhelming size
- **Eastern aesthetic**: Soft, contemplative quality suggesting Asian landscape painting traditions
- **Light quality**: Diffuse and ethereal, filtering through moisture-laden air
- **Mood**: Tranquil contemplation before nature's power

Lighting: **Diffuse atmospheric glow** softening the monumental rocks and cascading water.

## 4. Structural Layout

- **Left**: Tall evergreen trees anchoring the foreground, darker rock formations mid-height
- **Right**: Matching evergreens creating balance, rock outcroppings with foliage clusters
- **Center**: The waterfall as primary focal point, flowing from top to bottom
- **Upper canvas**: Massive misty rock faces receding into soft atmosphere
- **Midground**: Layered rock formations with waterfall cascading between them
- **Foreground**: Calm water reflecting the scene, small human figures at water's edge
- **Vertical structure**: Strong top-to-bottom movement emphasized by the falls

Depth style: **Layered atmospheric recession** with mist creating distance between rock planes.

## 5. Motion

- **Waterfall flow**: Powerful downward cascade with multiple tiers and turbulent sections
- **Mist rising**: Upward atmospheric movement contrasting with falling water
- **Water surface**: Gentle ripples in foreground pool where waterfall meets lake
- **Compositional flow**: Strong vertical pull downward along the falls
- **Eye movement**: Drawn upward along the cascading water to misty peaks, then down again
- **Atmospheric drift**: Soft horizontal mist layers create floating sensation

Motion profile: **Vertical cascade with rising mist counter-flow**

## 6. Technique

- **Rock formations**: Palette knife work creating angular, broken cliff faces
- **Mist effects**: Soft blending and highlighting to create atmospheric layers
- **Waterfall**: Vertical pulling strokes with Titanium White, varied pressure for foam and spray
- **Trees**: Fan brush evergreens with varied pressure for depth and scale
- **Foliage clusters**: Light touch-and-lift technique for moss and small bushes on rocks
- **Water reflections**: Horizontal smoothing strokes in foreground pool
- **Atmospheric blending**: Criss-cross and circular blending for soft, receding mist
- **Highlights**: Palette knife and brush highlights for waterfall definition and rock edges
- **Detail work**: Liner brush for tree branches, small figures, and fine details

Signature technique: **Layered mist with palette knife rocks and vertical waterfall highlights**

## 7. Narrative Layer

"A sacred waterfall tumbles through mist-shrouded cliffs, while tiny human figures stand in quiet reverence at its base. The Oriental-inspired composition emphasizes nature's overwhelming scale and timeless power, inviting contemplation and wonder. Heavy atmospheric mist softens the monumental rocks, creating a dreamlike境界 where water, stone, and air merge in eternal dance."

## 8. Initial Canvas Treatment

- **Base preparation**: Likely Liquid White or Liquid Clear for smooth blending
- **Sky and mist areas**: Thin application allowing for soft atmospheric effects
- **Water areas**: Wet surface for easy reflection work
- **Dark accents**: Applied early for rock shadows and depth
- **No contact paper**: Organic, painted edges throughout
- **No textured gesso**: Smooth surface for delicate mist effects

A smooth wet canvas foundation supporting extensive atmospheric blending and vertical waterfall drama.
