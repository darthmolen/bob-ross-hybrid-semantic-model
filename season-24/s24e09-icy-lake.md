## 7. Narrative Layer
"In the deep quiet of winter's twilight, the lake has surrendered completely to ice, its surface now a mirror for the rare pink-mauve sky above. The bare birch trees stand as patient witnesses to this frozen transformation, their white bark echoing the snow that blankets every surface. This is nature's pause button pressed—a moment when cold and beauty merge into perfect stillness, when the day's last light paints even winter's severity with unexpected warmth."

## 8. Initial Canvas Treatment
- **Liquid White** tinted with Alizarin Crimson applied across entire oval canvas
- Creates smooth blendable surface for pink-mauve sky and ice reflections
- Pink-tinted base provides warm undertone that unifies the winter color scheme
- Allows for seamless gradations between sky and frozen water surface
- Oval canvas pre-shaped or masked to create distinctive vignette format

Liquid White with pink tint establishes the foundation for this unique twilight winter scene on an oval canvas.
