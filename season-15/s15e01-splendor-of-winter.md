## 7. Narrative Layer

"In this winter sanctuary, nature exhales and time slows to the rhythm of falling snow. The golden trees stand as warm witnesses to the season's transformation, their amber tones defying winter's chill. A simple fence marks where wilderness meets human touch, yet both exist in harmony beneath the sun's benevolent gaze. The evergreens, dark and stoic, guard the valley's secrets while mountains dream beneath their blankets of white, waiting for spring's gentle awakening."

## 8. Initial Canvas Treatment
- Canvas likely prepared with thin coat of Liquid White for wet surface
- Possible tinted base with Phthalo Blue in upper sky region
- Wet foundation enables soft blending of atmospheric elements
- Strategic white placement for luminous sun halo effect

Base prepared for seamless wet-on-wet blending with emphasis on maintaining luminosity in sky and snow areas.
