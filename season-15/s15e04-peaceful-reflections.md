## 7. Narrative Layer
"In this alpine sanctuary, nature holds her breath. The mountains stand as eternal guardians over waters so still they've become a second sky, doubling the grandeur of the peaks above. A small peninsula dressed in spring's brightest colors dares to punctuate the cool blues and whites, a reminder that even in this realm of stone and ice, life finds its vibrant foothold. This is a place where silence speaks louder than words, where reflections invite us to see the world twice—once as it is, and once as it dreams itself to be."

## 8. Initial Canvas Treatment
- Canvas prepared with **Liquid White** base coat applied evenly across entire surface
- Thin, smooth application allows for seamless blending of sky and water
- White base enables brilliant color mixing and atmospheric effects
- Essential foundation for creating mirror-like reflections
- Wet surface facilitates wet-on-wet technique throughout

The Liquid White base transforms the canvas into a responsive surface where sky and water become one, allowing the reflections to emerge with crystalline clarity.
