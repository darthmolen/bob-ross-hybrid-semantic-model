- Heavy impasto application for white wave foam and highlights
- Fan brush work creating water movement and flow patterns
- Palette knife for angular rock formations
- Light touch for soft, billowing cloud formations
- Careful value control to show wave translucency
- Horizontal strokes emphasizing ocean's expanse
- Delicate highlighting to capture spray and mist

## 7. Narrative Layer

"Here the ocean reveals its dual nature — simultaneously beautiful and powerful, inviting yet commanding respect. The waves crash against ancient rocks in an eternal dance, each breaking wave a fleeting moment of spectacular beauty before dissolving back into the sea. This is a scene of pure natural drama, where the viewer stands safely on the shore to witness the magnificent display of nature's endless energy and the mesmerizing rhythm of the tides."

## 8. Initial Canvas Treatment
- Canvas pre-treated with Liquid White or Liquid Clear base
- Thin, even coating allowing smooth blending of blues
- Treatment enables the wet-on-wet technique essential for fluid water
- Base provides luminosity for sky and translucent wave effects

Initial treatment creates the foundation for dramatic oceanic atmosphere.
