## 2. Palette
- Prussian Blue (dominant sky gradations and shadow tones)
- Phthalo Blue (deep atmospheric shadows and sky variations)
- Titanium White (snow highlights, mountain caps, moonlight, frozen water)
- Midnight Black (evergreen trees, cabin silhouette, deepest shadows)
- Van Dyke Brown (cabin structure, tree trunks, warm undertones)
- Alizarin Crimson (subtle purple-pink tones in sky and snow shadows)
- Dark Sienna (cabin details and warm earth tones)

Palette identity: **Prussian Blue Moonlight Over Titanium Snow**

## 3. Mood & Atmosphere

## 4. Structural Layout

**Left:** Tall dark evergreens and rustic cabin create strong vertical anchor and human interest

**Center:** Snow-covered valley floor and lake transition to mountain foothills

**Right:** Dramatic snow-capped mountain peaks rise majestically, moon glowing above

**Foreground:** Snow-covered ground with subtle textures, cabin providing scale and warmth

**Midground:** Frozen lake or valley floor, distant tree line at mountain base

**Background:** Towering mountain range with sharp snow-covered peaks, deep blue twilight sky with moon

Depth style: **Atmospheric Perspective with Oval Vignette Compression**

Motion profile: **Frozen Stillness with Subtle Celestial Drift**

## 6. Technique
- Oval canvas format requiring careful composition within curved boundaries
- Wet-on-wet technique for smooth blue sky gradations
- Palette knife work for angular mountain peaks and snow textures
- Fan brush techniques for evergreen trees with winter definition
- Delicate highlight application for moonlight reflections on snow
- Careful vignetting to honor the oval format
- Liner brush details for cabin structure and tree branches
- Pushing and pulling technique for mountain contours and depth

Signature technique: **Oval Vignette Moonscape with Knife-Worked Mountain Drama**

## 7. Narrative Layer

"In this hidden oval window to another world, a lone cabin keeper watches the winter moon rise over guardian mountains. The blue luminescence transforms the frozen valley into a crystalline cathedral, where silence is sacred and solitude becomes sanctuary. This is the secret place where earth meets sky in perfect stillness, where moonlight paints the world in shades of peace, and where a single warm cabin light defies the vastness with gentle courage."

## 8. Initial Canvas Treatment
- Liquid Black or pre-toned dark blue base to establish the night sky foundation
- Oval format pre-masked or carefully maintained throughout painting process
- Base allows for smooth blending of blue sky tones
- Dark foundation enables brilliant snow highlights to emerge with maximum contrast
- Canvas treatment creates the mysterious depth essential for moonlit atmosphere

Treatment created the perfect foundation for ethereal moonlit winter drama within an elegant oval portal.
