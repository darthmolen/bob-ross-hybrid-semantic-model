## 7. Narrative Layer
"A wilderness stream tumbles through a mountain valley at the peak of autumn's glory, where a single golden tree blazes against the dark evergreen forest like nature's own torch. The water has traveled far from those distant purple peaks, gathering stories from each bend and pool, now rushing joyfully through this hidden meadow. Here, in this perfect moment of seasonal transition, the warm earth meets cool mountains, the moving water reflects the still sky, and the golden light of autumn holds back winter's approach for just a little while longer."

## 8. Initial Canvas Treatment
- Canvas treated with Liquid White to enable smooth wet-on-wet blending
- Even coating allows for the bright sky foundation and seamless transitions
- Treatment supports both delicate cloud work and bold dark evergreens
- Enables easy manipulation of golden highlights over darker bases

Started with a thin, even coat of Liquid White to create the luminous quality essential for autumn atmosphere.
