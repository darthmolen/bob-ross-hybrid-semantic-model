## 7. Narrative Layer

"A quiet winter forest bathed in the warm golden light of late afternoon. The tall evergreens stand sentinel as gentle sunlight filters through the distant trees, creating a peaceful sanctuary where snow and earth meet beneath the glowing sky. The rustic character emerges from the weathered bark and the simple beauty of a winter woodland at rest."

## 8. Initial Canvas Treatment

- White or light-toned canvas base
- Likely Liquid White application for blendability
