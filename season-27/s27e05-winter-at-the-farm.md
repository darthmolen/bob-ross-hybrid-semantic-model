- Snow-covered ground throughout with blue shadow areas
- Winding path or stream in the foreground with wooden fence posts running alongside
- Misty, atmospheric background with evergreen trees
- Soft, hazy sky with light blue and white atmospheric effects
- Rolling snow fields between structures and background
- Small evergreen trees flanking the left barn
- Gentle hillside or elevated background creating depth

A peaceful winter farm scene with dual structures set against a misty forest backdrop.

## 2. Palette

- Midnight Black for dark barn siding and evergreen trees
- Subtle blue-grey atmospheric tones for mist and depth
- Minimal warm accents in the structures
- High value contrast between white snow and dark structures

Palette identity: **cool winter palette with blue shadow tones and warm structural accents**

## 7. Narrative Layer

"A quiet winter morning at an old farm, where fresh snow blankets the fields and wooden fences mark forgotten paths. Two weathered barns stand in peaceful solitude, surrounded by misty evergreens that fade into the cold winter air. The scene captures the serene isolation and simple beauty of rural winter life."
