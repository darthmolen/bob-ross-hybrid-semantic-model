## 1. Composition

- **Landforms**: Dramatic snow-covered mountain range with multiple jagged peaks
- **Water features**: Peaceful stream flowing through center toward viewer
- **Trees and vegetation**: Dark evergreen trees flanking both sides, snow-laden branches
- **Sky conditions**: Dynamic diagonal cloud patterns suggesting active snowfall and wind
- **Structures**: None
- **Overall compositional archetype**: Mountain valley with river corridor

A dramatic winter mountain scene with active weather and central water feature.

## 2. Palette

- Titanium White (dominant: snow, mountain highlights, clouds, atmospheric effects)
- Prussian Blue (water, shadow depths in snow, sky tones, atmospheric depth)
- Van Dyke Brown (evergreen tree trunks, earth tones beneath snow)
- Alizarin Crimson (subtle warm tones in shadows, atmospheric mixing)
- Cool-dominant temperature with stark white highlights
- High value contrast between dark evergreens and brilliant snow
- Diagonal sweeping patterns in sky create movement

Palette identity: **high-contrast winter palette with dynamic atmospheric movement**

## 3. Mood & Atmosphere

- Dramatic and energetic
- Cold and pristine
- Active weather conditions
- Majestic wilderness
- Peaceful yet powerful
- Clear winter mountain air
- Sense of solitude in nature

Lighting: **diffuse overcast with directional wind** creating diagonal cloud patterns and active snowfall atmosphere.

## 4. Structural Layout

- **Left:** Dark evergreen trees with snow coverage, snow-covered riverbank
- **Right:** Matching evergreen trees framing the composition
- **Center:** Stream leading eye toward mountain range
- **Foreground:** Water with subtle reflections and snow-covered banks
- **Midground:** Trees and snowy terrain transitioning to mountains
- **Background:** Majestic mountain peaks with heavy snow and dramatic sky

Depth style: **layered planes with atmospheric perspective** and strong foreground-to-background progression.

## 5. Motion

- Strong diagonal cloud movement from upper right to lower left
- Active snowfall implied by sky patterns
- Stream flowing gently toward viewer
- Wind-driven atmospheric effects
- Compositional flow: diagonal sky movement contrasts with calm vertical water flow
- Sweeping brush strokes suggest weather in motion

Motion profile: **diagonal atmospheric movement with active weather patterns**

## 6. Technique

- Liquid White foundation for smooth blending
- Heavy palette knife impasto for mountain peaks and snow highlights
- Fan brush for evergreen trees
- Bold diagonal strokes for dramatic sky
- Criss-cross blending for cloud effects
- Pull-down reflections in water
- Feathering technique for snow on tree branches
- Horizontal smoothing for water surface
- Liner brush for fine tree details and twigs

Signature technique: **dramatic diagonal sky strokes creating weather movement over mountain landscape**

## 7. Narrative Layer

"A winter storm sweeps through a mountain valley, sending clouds racing diagonally across the sky while a peaceful stream flows undisturbed below. The majestic snow-covered peaks stand eternal against the dramatic weather, framed by dark evergreens that anchor the composition. The painting captures both the power of nature's weather and the serene beauty of an untouched winter wilderness."

## 8. Initial Canvas Treatment
