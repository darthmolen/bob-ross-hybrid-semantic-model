## 4. Structural Layout

- **Left:** Primary mountain peak, fallen tree in foreground
- **Right:** Secondary peak with prominent evergreen trees
- **Center:** Valley opening framed by mountain ridges
- **Foreground:** Bright green meadow with dead wood details
- **Midground:** Dark evergreen tree line and purple foothills
- **Background:** Snow-capped mountain peaks against soft sky

Depth style: **layered planes with atmospheric perspective**

## 5. Motion

- No water flow present
- Gentle atmospheric haze suggesting soft air movement
- Subtle cloud drift in upper sky
- Compositional flow guides eye from meadow through valley corridor to distant peaks
- Static, tranquil composition with vertical mountain thrust
- Overall sense of stillness and calm

Motion profile: **vertical mountain thrust with receding valley depth**

## 6. Technique

- Liquid White base for smooth blending throughout
- Palette knife work for mountain structure, peaks, and snow highlights
- Criss-cross blending for soft sky gradients
- Fan brush technique for evergreen trees and forest masses
- Layered color application for atmospheric depth in foothills
- Liner brush for dead tree branches and fine details
- Push-up technique for grassy meadow texture
- Firm bristle brush for dark evergreen silhouettes
- Highlight and shadow placement creating dimensional mountain forms

Signature technique: **layered atmospheric perspective using progressive value shifts from foreground to background**

## 7. Narrative Layer

"A serene mountain valley bathed in soft daylight, where a bright green meadow opens peacefully beneath towering snow-capped peaks. Dark evergreens frame the expansive vista, creating a natural gateway into the wilderness. The fallen tree in the foreground adds a touch of natural character, while the majestic mountains stand eternal against the gentle sky—a perfect portrait of nature's quiet grandeur."

## 8. Initial Canvas Treatment

- Liquid White base applied across the entire canvas
- Smooth, even coating for wet-on-wet blending
- No dark underpainting (early season technique)
- No contact paper masking
- No textured gesso
- Traditional wet surface preparation for seamless atmospheric transitions

A foundational Liquid White approach enabling soft sky gradients and smooth color blending typical of early Joy of Painting episodes.
