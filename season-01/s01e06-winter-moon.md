"A solitary cabin rests beneath a brilliant winter moon in the Alaska wilderness. The stark contrast between the glowing snow and deep night sky creates an atmosphere of peaceful isolation, where the cold beauty of a moonlit winter night transforms the mountain landscape into a luminous dreamscape. The mist adds mystery while the cabin offers a small beacon of warmth in the frozen vastness."

## 8. Initial Canvas Treatment
