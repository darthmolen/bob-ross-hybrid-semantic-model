- Gentle vertical pull from waterfall to mountain peak
- Compositional flow: **vertical waterfall cascade with center-focused mountain reflection**
- Contrast between dynamic foreground and tranquil background

Motion profile: **cascading downward flow anchored by reflective stillness**

## 6. Technique

- Liquid White foundation for smooth blending and atmospheric effects
- Palette knife work for rocky cliffs and mountain peaks
- Pull-down strokes for waterfall cascade
- Horizontal smoothing for water highlights and foam
- Fan brush evergreens with varying pressure
- Fan brush autumn foliage with warm color highlights
- Pull-down reflections for mirror-like lake surface
- Atmospheric blending for misty forest transition
- Prussian Blue shadows on mountain for dimensional form
- Liner brush for fine branches and water details
- Titanium White loaded brush for waterfall luminosity

Signature technique: **luminous waterfall cascade with heavy white paint over dark rocky foundation**

## 7. Narrative Layer

"A powerful waterfall tumbles over dark rocks into a tranquil mountain lake as the setting sun paints the sky in soft pink and peach tones. The majestic twin-peaked mountain rises beyond the misty forest, its snow-capped summit reflected perfectly in the still waters. Autumn's golden touch on one shore contrasts with the eternal green of the evergreens, creating a harmonious balance of seasonal change and timeless wilderness beauty. The scene captures the dynamic power of falling water and the serene majesty of alpine wilderness in a single breathtaking moment."

## 8. Initial Canvas Treatment

- Liquid White base for sky, mountain, and water areas
- Possible darker underpainting or heavier paint application for rocky cliff areas
- No contact paper masking
- No black gesso foundation
- Standard smooth surface preparation allowing for atmospheric blending and dramatic value contrasts

A foundational Liquid White technique with strategic darker areas supporting the dramatic interplay between luminous waterfall and shadowed rock formations.
