# Season 22, Episode 3 — "Around the Bend" (1990)

## 1. Composition
A winding river flows through a dense forest corridor, its waters curving gently from right to left in the classic S-curve that gives the episode its name. Tall, dark evergreen conifers rise vertically along the background, their spired silhouettes creating a dramatic tree line against patches of blue sky. The midground features lush green deciduous vegetation and bushes crowding the river banks, while rocky outcrops and stones punctuate the water's edge and shallow rapids. The foreground presents shadowed grasses and low vegetation along the water's near bank. The composition creates a naturalistic tunnel effect, drawing the eye through the forest clearing and along the river's serpentine path. Compositional archetype: **winding river through forest corridor**

## 2. Palette
Deep Prussian and Phthalo blues establish the sky and water reflections, while Midnight Black anchors the darkest conifers and shadows. Sap Green and Phthalo Green dominate the midground foliage and grassy banks, with Indian Yellow and Cadmium Yellow providing highlights on sunlit vegetation. Van Dyke Brown and Dark Sienna define tree trunks, river rocks, and earthen tones. Alizarin Crimson and Bright Red add subtle warmth to tree bark and undergrowth, while Yellow Ochre creates golden grassy tones. Titanium White brightens the water's rapids, sky, and creates the luminous quality in the river's flow. The palette moves from cool forest blues and greens to warm yellows and earth tones.
Palette identity: **forest green corridor with golden accents**

## 3. Mood & Atmosphere
The painting evokes a sense of peaceful solitude and discovery, as if the viewer has stumbled upon a hidden waterway deep in untouched wilderness. The atmosphere is fresh and cool, suggesting morning mist rising from the water or filtered sunlight penetrating the dense canopy. There's a gentle energy in the flowing water contrasted with the stillness of the surrounding forest, creating a meditative quality. The tunnel-like composition imparts both shelter and mystery, inviting exploration around the river's bend to discover what lies beyond.
Lighting: **filtered forest light** creating soft, dappled illumination through the tree canopy.

## 4. Structural Layout
The left side features dense dark conifers creating a vertical wall of forest, while the right side opens slightly with lighter green vegetation before transitioning to more evergreens. Center stage is dominated by the river itself, which enters from the right middle distance and curves toward the left foreground, creating the titular bend. The foreground is relatively dark with shadowed grasses and low bushes framing the water's near edge. The midground contains the brightest elements—sunlit green banks, vibrant bushes, and the active water with its white rapids flowing over rocks. The background rises with the tall evergreen tree line creating depth and enclosure, while glimpses of blue sky peek through the upper portions. The spatial arrangement creates a pronounced recession from dark near to bright middle to dark distance.
Depth style: **layered forest recession with luminous center**

## 5. Motion
The river provides the primary motion, its waters flowing energetically from right to left with visible white rapids suggesting movement over rocks and through shallow sections. The water's surface shows directional brushwork indicating current and flow, with the S-curve creating a rhythmic, meandering movement through the scene. The vertical conifers stand static and sentinel-like, contrasting with the horizontal flow of water. The foliage appears still, though the varied brushwork in the midground bushes creates textural activity. The overall motion is gentle but persistent—the steady, timeless flow of water through an ancient forest.
Motion profile: **gentle meandering current**

## 6. Technique
Fan brush work creates the delicate evergreen needles with upward strokes, building the characteristic spired shapes of the conifers. Palette knife work is evident in the rocky outcrops along the water's edge and the rough texture of tree bark. The water employs horizontal brushstrokes with Titanium White dragged over darker values to create the illusion of moving rapids and reflective surfaces. Midground foliage uses the 1-inch brush with push-up strokes and tapping motions to build bushy, organic forms. Highlights on grasses and vegetation are applied with thin liner brush for individual blades and stems. The Black Gesso base allows the dark values to remain rich and deep without excessive paint buildup. Van Dyke Brown underpainting likely established the water's initial flow pattern before lighter values were added.
Signature technique: **horizontal water flow with white highlights over dark base**

## 7. Narrative Layer
"This is a place where time slows to the rhythm of water over stone, where ancient trees stand guard over a secret passage known only to forest creatures and wandering souls. The river's bend promises something just beyond sight—perhaps a waterfall, a meadow, or simply more forest—but the mystery itself is the invitation. Here in this green cathedral, the water speaks in whispers, carving its patient path through wilderness, reminding us that the most beautiful destinations often require following the winding route rather than the straight line."

## 8. Initial Canvas Treatment
The canvas was treated with Black Gesso, providing a dark foundation that serves multiple purposes in this woodland scene. This black base allows the deep forest shadows and evergreen silhouettes to maintain their intensity without requiring multiple layers of dark paint. The Black Gesso shows through in the deepest shadow areas of the foreground and in the darkest portions of the background conifers, creating natural depth and richness. This dark foundation also allows the lighter elements—the flowing water, sunlit grasses, and sky—to appear more luminous by contrast, enhancing the painting's dynamic range. The Black Gesso treatment creates an efficient foundation for this high-contrast forest scene with its interplay of shadow and light.
