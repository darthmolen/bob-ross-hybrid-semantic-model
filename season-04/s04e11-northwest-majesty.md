## 1. Composition
- Snow-capped mountain range dominates the background with multiple peaks
- Dense forest of autumn deciduous trees fills the middle ground and foreground
- Tall dead or bare trees with exposed trunks on the left side
- Bright yellow-green foliage (likely aspen or birch) throughout
- Single prominent orange-red autumn tree in center-left foreground
- Purple-lavender sky with white cumulus clouds
- No water features or man-made structures present

This work exemplifies the autumn mountain wilderness archetype with layered depth from foreground forest to distant peaks.

## 4. Structural Layout
- **Left:** Tall dead trees with bare trunks, yellow deciduous trees behind
- **Right:** Dense autumn foliage, mix of yellow and green trees
- **Center:** Snow-capped mountain peaks, orange-red featured tree in middle ground
- **Foreground:** Base of colorful autumn trees creating forest floor edge
- **Background:** Layered mountain range with snow and blue-grey shadows

Depth style: **Atmospheric layering from vibrant foreground to distant alpine peaks**

## 5. Motion
- Vertical thrust of tall bare tree trunks drawing eye upward
- Diagonal flow from lower corners toward central mountain peaks
- Cloud formations create horizontal movement across purple sky
- Tree canopy masses create rhythmic texture across middle plane
- Mountain peaks establish strong upward triangular motion
- Overall compositional flow moves from warm foreground depth to cool distant heights

---

## 6. Technique
- **Fan brush**: Dense foliage masses created with upward tapping motions
- **Liner brush**: Fine branches and dead tree details
- **1-inch brush**: Sky gradations and cloud base layers
- **Knife work**: Mountain peaks shaped with angular strokes, snow highlights
- **Layering**: Multiple yellow-green tones built up for foliage depth
- **Highlight technique**: Bright yellow and white touches on sunlit foliage edges
- **Trunk technique**: Dark vertical strokes with lighter side highlights
- **Sky blending**: Purple and blue tones softly merged with criss-cross strokes

Signature technique: **Vibrant autumn foliage masses with fan brush tapping**

## 7. Narrative Layer
"A wilderness vista captures the fleeting glory of autumn in the Pacific Northwest, where golden aspen and birch forests blaze against the eternal presence of snow-draped peaks. The unusual purple sky suggests either the magical quality of alpenglow at day's end or the guest painter's personal interpretive vision. Dead standing trees remind viewers of nature's cycles, while the vibrant surrounding foliage celebrates seasonal transformation in the high country."

## 8. Initial Canvas Treatment
- **Base coat**: Likely white gesso or light base for bright color foundation
- **Sky application**: Purple and blue tones applied wet with horizontal strokes
- **Background wash**: Light blue-grey tones established for mountain distance
- **Cloud foundation**: White applied into wet sky with circular blending

The bright base treatment supports the vivid autumn color palette and maintains luminosity throughout the composition.
