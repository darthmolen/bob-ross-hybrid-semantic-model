# Season 4, Episode 3 — "Majestic Mountains" (1985)

---

## 1. Composition
- Multi-peaked mountain range with snow-capped summits dominates upper two-thirds
- Rocky cliff faces with brown and gray striations beneath snow line
- Rolling green meadows with gentle undulations in middle ground
- Single tall conifer tree left foreground acts as compositional anchor
- Scattered evergreen trees populate meadow slopes
- Small stream or path winds through lower foreground
- Bright blue sky with minimal cloud coverage
- Classic alpine valley archetype with dramatic vertical scale contrast between foreground and background elements.

---

## 2. Palette
- Titanium White for snow coverage and bright highlights
- Prussian Blue and Midnight Black for mountain shadow areas
- Van Dyke Brown and Dark Sienna for rocky cliff faces
- Sap Green and Yellow Ochre for sunlit meadow grasses
- Phthalo Blue for clear alpine sky
- Cadmium Yellow for meadow highlights
- Alizarin Crimson for subtle warmth in rock shadows

Palette identity: **High-altitude spring with snow-grass contrast**

---

## 3. Mood & Atmosphere
- Bright, crystalline alpine clarity with high-altitude luminosity
- Direct sunlight from upper right creates strong light-shadow definition
- Spring or early summer season with fresh meadow growth
- Serene expansiveness emphasizing nature's scale
- Inviting warmth in foreground contrasts with distant cold peaks

Lighting: **Direct diagonal sunlight with high-altitude clarity**

---

## 4. Structural Layout
- **Left:** Tall conifer tree in foreground, additional evergreens on mountain slopes
- **Right:** Open meadow view with unobstructed sight lines to peaks
- **Center:** Dominant mountain range with central peak as focal anchor
- **Foreground:** Stream or path with grassy banks and immediate detail
- **Background:** Snow-covered mountain summits with atmospheric perspective

Depth style: **Dramatic foreground-to-background compression with vertical emphasis**

---

## 5. Motion
- Water flow implied from mountain snowmelt through foreground stream
- Diagonal meadow contours create sweeping compositional flow from lower left to upper right
- Subtle cloud movement horizontally across sky
- Visual ascent from valley floor to mountain peaks guides viewer's eye upward
- Grass highlight strokes suggest breeze movement

---

## 6. Technique
- Palette knife work for angular mountain peaks and snow deposits
- Fan brush for conifer tree foliage and scattered evergreens
- Large brush sweeping strokes for meadow grass layers
- Liquid White base enables smooth sky and meadow blending
- Vertical pulling technique for cliff face striations
- Highlighting with bright yellows and whites for sunlit grass
- Layering technique builds depth through value progression

Signature technique: **Knife-sculpted peaks with sweeping meadow brushwork**

---

## 7. Narrative Layer
"The viewer stands at the threshold of an alpine meadow where spring has arrived in the valley while winter still crowns the peaks. A solitary evergreen marks the foreground boundary between human scale and the wilderness beyond. The massive mountains assert nature's permanence above the seasonal transformation of the meadows, creating a scene of timeless alpine grandeur."

---

## 8. Initial Canvas Treatment
- Liquid White base applied across entire canvas for wet-on-wet blending
- Thin, even coating enables smooth color transitions in sky and meadows
- Base maintains workability for layered meadow detail and atmospheric blending
The foundational Liquid White treatment supports both delicate sky work and bold mountain knife application while maintaining meadow luminosity.
