## 3. Mood & Atmosphere
- Powerful and turbulent energy
- Evening darkness creating mysterious depth
- Wild, untamed coastal forces
- Cool-dominated temperature suggesting night approach
- Dramatic tension between water and stone

Lighting: **Ambient evening glow with selective wave illumination**

## 4. Structural Layout
- **Left:** Rocky outcropping extending into surf
- **Right:** Large crashing wave against dark rock formation
- **Center:** Multiple wave breaks with white foam patterns
- **Foreground:** Sandy beach with scattered dark stones
- **Background:** Storm clouds and distant wave action

Depth style: **Layered wave progression from distant sky to immediate shore**

---

## 5. Motion
- Waves crashing diagonally from background toward foreground
- Right-to-left compositional flow in primary wave structure
- Foam and spray suggesting explosive water-rock collision
- Swirling cloud movement echoing ocean turbulence
- Dynamic energy concentrated in center-right wave break

---

## 6. Technique
- Fan brush for delicate wave foam and spray effects
- Palette knife for sharp rocky edges and highlights
- Wet-on-wet blending for translucent wave bodies
- Push-pull technique creating wave dimensional structure
- Pure titanium white loaded heavily for bright foam contrast
- Dark-to-light layering building wave luminosity
- Circular strokes for cloud formations

Signature technique: **Dramatic foam highlighting against dark water base**

## 7. Narrative Layer
"An evening storm reveals the eternal contest between ocean and shore, where powerful waves hurl themselves against ancient rocks in endless rhythm. The fading light captures a single moment of this timeless dance, freezing the spray and foam in their violent beauty. Nature's raw power dominates this coastal sanctuary, reminding us of forces beyond human scale."
