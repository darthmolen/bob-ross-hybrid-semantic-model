# Season 4, Episode 8 — "Wetlands" (1985)

---

## 1. Composition
- Low-angle wetland scene with still water as central element
- Spanish moss-draped trees frame left and right edges
- Dense tree clusters create natural archway effect
- Cloudy sky occupies upper third with dramatic cloud formations
- Water extends from foreground into middle distance
- Autumn vegetation along water's edge in warm oranges and yellows
- Background trees emerge through atmospheric haze
- No human structures; pure wilderness environment
Compositional archetype: **symmetrical wetland corridor with overhead canopy framing**

---

## 2. Palette
- Titanium White for cloud highlights and Spanish moss
- Van Dyke Brown for dark tree trunks and shadows
- Sap Green and Yellow Ochre for foliage masses
- Bright Red and Indian Yellow for autumn undergrowth
- Dark Sienna for water reflections and banks
- Phthalo Blue muted for sky undertones
- Alizarin Crimson for warm accents in foliage
Palette identity: **autumn wetland with muted atmospheric grays**

---

## 3. Mood & Atmosphere
- Humid, overcast ambiance with soft diffused light
- Mysterious quality from Spanish moss and mist
- Tranquil stillness of undisturbed water
- Melancholic autumn tones suggest seasonal transition
- Enclosed, intimate feeling from overhanging vegetation
- Southern swamp character with hanging moss
Lighting: **overcast diffused with no direct sun**

---

## 4. Structural Layout
- **Left:** Dark tree cluster with autumn foliage, vegetation along bank
- **Right:** Prominent Spanish moss hanging from trees, mixed green and brown foliage
- **Center:** Still water with reflections, receding into misty background
- **Foreground:** Water surface with bank vegetation in warm autumn colors
- **Background:** Hazy tree line creates atmospheric depth, sky with cloud formations

Depth style: **atmospheric recession through progressive softening and mist**

---

## 5. Motion
- Static water surface suggests complete stillness
- Spanish moss implies potential for gentle breeze
- Vertical moss strands create downward visual pull
- Compositional flow follows water corridor into depth
- Cloud formations suggest atmospheric movement above
- Reflections anchor vertical elements to horizontal plane

---

## 6. Technique
- Fan brush for Spanish moss in delicate downward strokes
- Palette knife for tree trunk texture and bark detail
- 2-inch brush for foliage masses using push-up technique
- Wet-on-wet blending for atmospheric sky
- Liquid white/clear base for water reflections
- Liner brush for fine moss tendrils and hanging elements
- Light touch for reflections pulled straight down into water
Signature technique: **Spanish moss created with fan brush dragging**

---

## 7. Narrative Layer
"A secluded Southern wetland where time seems suspended beneath the weight of Spanish moss. The overcast sky casts no shadows, rendering the scene timeless and dreamlike. Autumn colors glow softly against the muted atmosphere, suggesting a place of quiet solitude far from human presence. The still water mirrors the trees above, doubling the sense of enclosure and creating a sanctuary within the wilderness."

## 8. Initial Canvas Treatment
- Liquid white applied across entire canvas for wet-on-wet technique
- Sky area worked first with darker values for overcast clouds
- Water area likely received thin liquid white layer for reflection work
- No heavy impasto in initial treatment; smooth blended base
Foundation approach: **thin liquid white for atmospheric blending and water reflections**
