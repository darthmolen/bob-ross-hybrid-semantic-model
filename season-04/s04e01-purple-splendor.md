## 5. Motion
- Horizontal flow created by frozen water surface in foreground
- Diagonal snow contours guide eye from lower left toward cabin
- Misty forest band creates soft lateral atmospheric movement
- Tree placement channels viewer focus from edges toward central cabin
- Fence line creates receding perspective motion into middle ground

## 6. Technique
- Fan brush loading for evergreen foliage with downward strokes
- Knife work for cabin structure and snow-covered roof planes
- Large brush crisscross blending for purple sky gradations
- Liquid White base with purple glaze overlay (Alizarin Crimson + Prussian Blue)
- Wet-on-wet technique throughout for seamless color transitions
- Atmospheric blending for misty forest effect using soft brush strokes
- Knife highlights for snow contours and reflective ice surface
- Vertical tree trunk detailing with liner brush

Signature technique: **purple atmospheric glazing over luminous white base**

## 7. Narrative Layer
"A solitary cabin rests in winter silence beneath a lavender sky, where snow and atmosphere merge into a purple-hued dreamscape. The frozen world transforms familiar winter elements into an ethereal realm, where evergreens stand as dark sentinels framing the peaceful refuge. Purple shadows stretch across ice and snow, creating a mystical interpretation of winter's quiet beauty."
