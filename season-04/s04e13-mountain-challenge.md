## 2. Palette
- **Titanium White** — snow caps, cloud streaks, water highlights, reflection light
- **Prussian Blue** — sky foundation, lake body, atmospheric depth
- **Phthalo Blue** — water shadows, deep lake tones
- **Sap Green** — foothills, grassy areas, evergreen base
- **Van Dyke Brown** — dark tree mass, shadows, foreground earth
- **Yellow Ochre** — grassy highlights, shoreline warmth
- **Alizarin Crimson** — mountain shadows, subtle pink tones in snow
- **Cadmium Yellow** — bright grass accents, warmth highlights

Palette identity: **Cool alpine clarity with warm foreground contrast**

## 4. Structural Layout
- **Left:** Dark deciduous foliage mass, mountain flank extending to edge
- **Right:** Two prominent evergreen trees, mountain slope descent
- **Center:** Snow-capped peak apex, lake with mirror reflections, cloud formations
- **Foreground:** Grassy shoreline with ochre and brown earth tones, textured ground
- **Background:** Mountain peak with pink-white snow, wispy cloud layer, blue sky gradient

Depth style: **Layered atmospheric recession with distinct spatial planes**

---

## 5. Motion
- Horizontal cloud streaks suggest high-altitude wind movement
- Calm lake surface with minimal ripple texture
- Diagonal compositional flow from lower left foreground to upper right peak
- Static, anchored mountain mass provides stability
- Gentle atmospheric movement in sky contrasts with still water

---

## 6. Technique
- **Palette knife exclusively** — entire painting constructed without brushes
- Angular, geometric strokes create mountain facets and edges
- Horizontal knife pulls define water surface and reflections
- Vertical knife strokes build evergreen tree forms
- Heavy impasto texture in foreground grasses and earth
- Sharp edge definition throughout from knife work
- Scraping technique for cloud streaks
- Layered knife strokes create foliage masses

Signature technique: **Pure palette knife construction with bold impasto texturing**

## 7. Narrative Layer
"A magnificent snow-crowned peak rises in alpine splendor, its pristine form mirrored in the tranquil lake below. Verdant foothills roll gently toward the water's edge where grasses meet the shore, while sentinel evergreens stand watch over this remote sanctuary. Wispy clouds race across the brilliant sky, the only movement in an otherwise frozen moment of mountain majesty."

## 8. Initial Canvas Treatment
- Thin blue-white wash establishes sky gradient
- Lighter tones at horizon transition to deeper blue overhead
- Base layer preparation for subsequent knife application
- Minimal wet-on-wet foundation allows knife work to dominate

Canvas prepared with graduated sky wash to support exclusive palette knife technique throughout painting process.
