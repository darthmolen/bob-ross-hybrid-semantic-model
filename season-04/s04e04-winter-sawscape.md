# Season 4, Episode 4 — "Winter Sawscape" (1985)

---

## 1. Composition
- Snowcapped mountain rises on left background, angular peak against soft sky
- Frozen lake occupies center, mirror-smooth surface creating perfect reflection
- Rustic cabin positioned left middleground, warm brown against cool blues
- Bare deciduous tree dominates right foreground, stark branches reaching upward
- Snow-covered evergreen bushes cluster left and center foreground
- Split-rail fence runs horizontally through middleground, partially snow-laden
- Painted on circular sawblade canvas with serrated edge visible
This painting employs a **centered reflective archetype** with asymmetric flanking elements and circular canvas format.

## 2. Palette
- Prussian Blue forms deep shadows in snow and water reflections
- Titanium White creates brilliant snow highlights and sky luminosity
- Van Dyke Brown constructs cabin structure and tree trunk
- Phthalo Blue establishes cool sky tones and water base
- Midnight Black defines tree branches and dark accents
- Burnt Umber warms cabin roof and fence rails
- Alizarin Crimson adds subtle warmth to cabin walls

Palette identity: **Cool-dominant winter blues with warm architectural accent**

---

## 3. Mood & Atmosphere
- Tranquil winter solitude with inhabited warmth
- Crisp, cold air suggested by sharp blue shadows
- Peaceful isolation broken only by cabin's presence
- Serene stillness captured in glassy lake reflection
- Soft overcast ambiance without harsh contrasts

Lighting: **Diffused winter daylight with gentle overcast**

---

## 4. Structural Layout
- **Left:** Mountain peak, cabin structure, clustered evergreens
- **Right:** Bare deciduous tree, snow-covered ground, sparse vegetation
- **Center:** Reflective frozen lake, fence line, distant shore
- **Foreground:** Snow mounds, low bushes, tree base, sawblade edge
- **Background:** Mountain silhouette, soft sky gradient, atmospheric haze

Depth style: **Layered horizontal bands with central reflection doubling depth**

---

## 5. Motion
- Lake surface perfectly still, creating mirror-image reflection
- Diagonal fence line guides eye from left middleground to center
- Tree branches radiate outward and upward from right anchor point
- Mountain slope descends from left to center, directing flow
- Circular canvas format creates contained, self-referential composition

---

## 6. Technique
- Knife work constructs cabin walls, roof, and fence rails
- Fan brush creates evergreen foliage texture
- Liner brush details bare tree branches and twigs
- Wet-on-wet blending establishes sky and mountain gradients
- Reflection technique mirrors upper elements in still water
- Special canvas treatment accommodates circular sawblade surface
- Highlight scraping creates snow texture on fence and branches

Signature technique: **Mirror-perfect water reflection on unconventional circular canvas**

---

## 7. Narrative Layer
"A lone cabin stands watch over a frozen wilderness, its warm presence a human anchor in an otherwise untouched winter landscape. The glassy lake doubles the world above, creating a meditation on symmetry and stillness. The bare tree reaches skyward like a skeletal sentinel, while the cabin offers silent promise of shelter and warmth within the cold blue embrace of winter."

---

## 8. Initial Canvas Treatment
- Circular sawblade prepared with base coating for oil adhesion
- Sky area established with Phthalo Blue and Titanium White blend
- Wet-on-wet foundation allows for seamless blending on metal surface
- Background mountain shapes blocked in while sky remains wet
- Water area coordinated with sky treatment for reflective continuity

The unconventional circular canvas required adapted wet-on-wet technique to maintain painterly flow within the sawblade's geometric constraints.
