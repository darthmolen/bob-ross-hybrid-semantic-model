## 7. Narrative Layer
"In the quiet awakening of early spring, nature stages its annual resurrection along a peaceful stream. A flowering tree bursts into delicate pink bloom while sturdy evergreens stand as steadfast witnesses to the seasonal transformation. The bare tree, still dormant, waits patiently beside its flowering neighbor, while fresh yellow-green growth carpets the rolling hills beneath soft lavender mountains—a gentle reminder that renewal arrives in its own perfect time."

## 8. Initial Canvas Treatment
The canvas received a complete coating of Liquid White applied with broad horizontal and vertical strokes, creating a smooth wet surface essential for the soft atmospheric blending visible in the distant mountains. This thineven base allowed for seamless color transitions in the sky and enabled the delicate pink mountain haze to melt into the background. The wet foundation facilitated the smooth water reflections and permitted the gentle blending of spring greens across the rolling hillsides while maintaining enough tooth for the textured palette knife work in the rocky foreground embankment.
