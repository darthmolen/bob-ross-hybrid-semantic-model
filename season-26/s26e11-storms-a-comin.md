## 6. Technique
- Wet-on-wet for seamless cloud formations and blending
- Aggressive palette knife work for wave foam and spray
- Heavy impasto creates dimensional wave texture
- Fan brush likely used for mist and atmospheric effects
- Dark base coat provides dramatic foundation
- Lifted highlights in clouds using circular brushwork
- Oval composition requires careful edge control

Signature technique: **Violent palette knife impasto for explosive wave foam**

## 7. Narrative Layer
"A massive storm descends upon a rocky coastline where the ocean rises up in defiant fury. The wave crashes against ancient stones in one final brilliant explosion of white foam before the darkness consumes all. This is nature's warning—a spectacular display of power in the moments before the tempest's full violence is unleashed upon the shore."

## 8. Initial Canvas Treatment
The canvas was prepared with a dark base coat, likely Liquid Black or a very dark blue mixture, establishing the moody, dramatic foundation essential for this storm scene. The oval format suggests either a pre-made oval canvas or a carefully masked circular composition on a rectangular surface. This dark underpainting allows the explosive whites and bright highlights to achieve maximum dramatic impact, creating the violent contrasts that define the painting's tempestuous character.
