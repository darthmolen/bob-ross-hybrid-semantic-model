- Palette knife work creates crisp mountain peaks and snow highlights
- Fan brush technique builds the evergreen tree structures
- Soft blending creates atmospheric mist over water
- Dark value mixing establishes foreground tree silhouettes
- Light feathering suggests distant haze and depth
- Vertical pull strokes define water reflections

Signature technique: **Knife-worked mountain peaks with atmospheric mist blending**

## 7. Narrative Layer
"In the hushed moments after the season's first snowfall, the mountain stands transformed, wearing its winter crown with quiet dignity. The lake below mirrors this transformation, its surface still and contemplative, breathing gentle mist into the cold morning air. This is nature's moment of pause—that sacred silence between autumn's farewell and winter's full embrace, where even the evergreens seem to hold their breath in reverence."

## 8. Initial Canvas Treatment
The canvas received a liquid white base treatment, likely with a subtle pink tint pre-blended to establish the warm dawn atmosphere. This preparation allows the cool mountain tones to contrast beautifully against the warmer sky, while enabling smooth wet-on-wet blending throughout. The treatment provides the luminosity needed for both the snow highlights and the atmospheric mist effects. The foundation creates a cohesive color harmony that unifies the entire winter scene.
