## 7. Narrative Layer
"A majestic mountain wilderness celebrates the arrival of early autumn, where summer's green evergreens stand witness to the first golden transformation of deciduous companions. The peaceful stream continues its eternal journey through the meadow, reflecting the unchanging mountain while the seasons dance around it. This is nature's gentle reminder that change and permanence coexist in perfect harmony, framed like a treasured memory within an oval window to tranquility."

## 8. Initial Canvas Treatment
The canvas was prepared with a generous coating of Liquid White to enable the wet-on-wet technique essential for smooth blending in the sky and water areas. An oval mask or template was applied to create the distinctive vignette format, concentrating the composition within an intimate, portrait-like frame. This preparation allows for soft edge transitions where the painting fades into the dark border, creating a window-like viewing experience that draws focus to the central mountain scene.
