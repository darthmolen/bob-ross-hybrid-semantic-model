## 7. Narrative Layer
"Deep in the forest gorge, where few travelers venture, a waterfall thunders through the darkness, revealed only when the moon breaks through the canopy above. The silvery cascade becomes a beacon in the night, transforming the hidden chasm into a cathedral of natural power and celestial light. This is a place where the earth's raw energy meets the gentle touch of moonbeams, creating a sanctuary both wild and sacred."

## 8. Initial Canvas Treatment
The canvas was prepared with a heavy application of Liquid Black or a dark blue-black mixture, creating the deep nocturnal foundation essential for this nighttime scene. This dark base allowed the moonlit highlights to appear luminous and dramatic when applied later, with the wet-on-wet technique enabling smooth transitions between the deep shadows and silvery illuminated areas. The preparation established the mysterious, theatrical atmosphere from the very beginning.
