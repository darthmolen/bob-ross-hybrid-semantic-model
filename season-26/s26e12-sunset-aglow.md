## 7. Narrative Layer
"As daylight surrenders to the approaching night, the sky transforms into a theatrical display of purple and pink majesty, with towering clouds catching the last golden rays of the setting sun. The snow-capped mountains stand as silent witnesses to this daily spectacle, their reflections dancing softly in the calm lake below. This is nature's grand finale—a moment of pure tranquility where the world pauses to admire the beauty in endings and the promise that tomorrow will bring another dawn."

## 8. Initial Canvas Treatment
The canvas was treated with a light base coating, likely Liquid White or a very light-tinted wash, which enabled the smooth color blending and vibrant transitions visible throughout the sky. This wet foundation allowed the warm yellows and oranges at the horizon to blend seamlessly through the pinks and into the rich purples of the upper atmosphere, creating the luminous sunset glow effect that gives this painting its radiant quality.
