# Season 16, Episode 13 — "Wooded Stream Oval" (1988)

## 1. Composition
- Oval vignette format creating an intimate window into a woodland sanctuary
- Gentle stream flowing through the center, drawing the eye from foreground to misty background
- Large deciduous trees with full canopies frame both left and right sides of the oval
- Dark rocky formations anchor the composition on both banks
- Atmospheric mist fills the background, creating mysterious depth
- Moss-covered stones and boulders populate the foreground shoreline
- No sky visible—the oval is entirely filled with woodland elements
Composition archetype: **Oval Stream Portal**

## 2. Palette
- Midnight Black forms the foundation for rocks and dark shadows
- Prussian Blue and Phthalo Blue create the reflective stream water
- Sap Green dominates the lush tree foliage and moss
- Yellow Ochre and Cadmium Yellow provide bright highlights on leaves
- Titanium White generates the ethereal mist and water highlights
- Van Dyke Brown defines tree trunks and deeper shadows
- Dark Sienna adds warmth to rocky surfaces and earth tones
Palette identity: **Misty Woodland Green**

## 3. Mood & Atmosphere
- Mysterious and contemplative, as if discovering a hidden woodland grotto
- Soft, diffused lighting filtered through atmospheric mist
- Peaceful sanctuary feeling enhanced by the oval frame's intimate viewpoint
- Cool, damp atmosphere suggesting early morning or twilight hours
- The mist creates a dreamlike quality, separating viewer from the distant woods
Lighting: **Diffused Mist Light**

## 4. Structural Layout
- Left: Overhanging deciduous tree with full foliage cascading down, dark rocks beneath creating strong vertical anchor
- Right: Mirror composition with leafy trees and boulder formations balancing the left side
- Center: Stream channel flowing toward viewer through misty atmospheric depth
- Foreground: Dark rocky shore with moss and small stones providing immediate detail
- Midground: The stream surface with gentle ripples and reflections
- Background: Soft misty void with suggestion of distant trees dissolving into atmosphere
Depth style: **Oval Atmospheric Recession**

## 5. Motion
- Stream flows gently forward from the misty background toward the viewer
- Water creates subtle ripples and movement around rocks
- Mist appears to rise or settle, creating vertical atmospheric motion
- Compositional flow follows the stream's path through the center
- Tree foliage suggests gentle stillness, no wind movement
- The oval frame itself creates circular visual flow around the perimeter
Motion profile: **Gentle Stream Through Mist**

## 6. Technique
- Oval vignette format with soft-edged fading into the dark background
- Fan brush work creates the full, leafy deciduous tree canopies
- Heavy palette knife application builds the dimensional rocks and boulders
- Blending and atmospheric technique generates the soft background mist
- Vertical pull-down strokes for water reflections
- Highlighting on rocks using knife to catch light on edges
- Moss indicated with small touches of light green on rock surfaces
- This oval format demonstrates Bob's versatility in working beyond traditional rectangular compositions.

## 7. Narrative Layer
"A secret stream discovered deep in the forest, where mist clings to the water and ancient rocks guard the passage. The oval frame transforms the viewer into a voyeur, peering through a portal into nature's private sanctuary. Time seems suspended in this hushed glen where water whispers over stones and trees lean in to listen, creating a moment of pure woodland mystery."

## 8. Initial Canvas Treatment
- Liquid White base applied across the oval area to allow wet-on-wet blending
- The background likely began with dark values establishing the oval perimeter
- Initial misty atmosphere laid in with soft blues and whites
- Foundation provided mobility for water reflections and atmospheric effects
- The oval format required careful planning to fade edges into the surrounding darkness while maintaining rich detail within the frame.
