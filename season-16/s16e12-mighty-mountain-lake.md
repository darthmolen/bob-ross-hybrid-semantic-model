## 7. Narrative Layer
"In the high country, where eagles soar and the air tastes of pine and snow, a mighty mountain stands sentinel over its mirror lake. This is a place of profound stillness, where time itself seems to pause, and the majesty of nature speaks in whispers across the glassy water. Here, in this pristine alpine sanctuary, the soul finds both humility and peace."
