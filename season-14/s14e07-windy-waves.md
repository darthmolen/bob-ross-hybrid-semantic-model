# Season 14, Episode 7 — "Windy Waves" (1988)

## 1. Composition
- Dominant billowing cumulus cloud formation occupying upper two-thirds
- Turbulent ocean with multiple rolling wave crests in midground
- Windswept palm trees (2-3 specimens) on right side, leaning dramatically
- Sandy beach shoreline in foreground
- Rocky outcropping lower right with coastal vegetation
- Deep blue sky visible through cloud gaps
- Compositional archetype: tropical storm seascape with dynamic wind-driven elements

## 2. Palette
- **Phthalo Blue** — deep ocean and sky base
- **Prussian Blue** — darker water depths and shadow tones
- **Midnight Black** — cloud shadows and deep water
- **Titanium White** — cloud highlights and wave foam
- **Yellow Ochre** — sunlit cloud edges and sand
- **Indian Yellow** — warm cloud illumination
- **Sap Green** — tropical foliage
- **Van Dyke Brown** — palm trunks and shadows
- **Dark Sienna** — rocks and earth tones

Palette identity: **Storm-Lit Tropical Drama**

## 3. Mood & Atmosphere
- Powerful, turbulent energy with approaching or passing storm system
- Dramatic interplay of dark storm clouds and brilliant sunlit highlights
- Wind-driven intensity evident in palm movement and wave action
- Emotional resonance balances danger with natural beauty and raw power
- Golden light breaking through suggests hope amid tumult

Lighting: **Dramatic Storm Backlighting**

## 4. Structural Layout
- **Left:** Open ocean expanse, large wave formations, towering cloud masses
- **Right:** Windswept palms, green vegetation cluster, rocky coastal outcrop
- **Center:** Transition zone from active ocean to protected shore
- **Foreground:** Sandy beach with textured surface, dark rocks, vegetation base
- **Midground:** Multiple wave lines with white foam crests, churning water
- **Background:** Massive cumulus clouds with dark undersides and brilliant highlights

Depth style: **Layered Atmospheric Recession**

## 5. Motion
- Strong horizontal wave progression moving toward shore
- Wind vector evident in palm tree lean (left to right)
- Vertical cloud billowing with implied updraft movement
- Diagonal compositional flow from upper left cloud mass down through waves
- Foam patterns suggest wind-driven spray and active water surface

Motion profile: **Wind-Driven Turbulence**

## 6. Technique
- Knife work for wave crests, foam patterns, and rocky textures
- Fan brush for palm fronds showing wind distortion
- Large brush (2-inch) for cloud masses with circular blending
- Cross-hatching strokes in water for movement texture
- Highlight technique with pure white on wave tops and cloud edges
- Push-pull blending in sky for atmospheric depth
- Liner brush for palm trunks and fine vegetation details
- Stippling motion for sandy beach texture

## 7. Narrative Layer
"A tropical paradise confronts the raw power of an approaching storm, where windswept palms bow before nature's fury while mighty clouds tower overhead. The ocean responds with churning waves that crash toward shore, their white crests catching the last golden light breaking through the storm system. This is a moment of transition—wild beauty suspended between calm and chaos, where the viewer witnesses the awesome spectacle of elemental forces in motion."

## 8. Initial Canvas Treatment
Foundation began with Liquid White application for smooth blending capability in clouds and water. Darker base tones of Phthalo Blue and Midnight Black likely pre-applied in sky areas to establish storm cloud depth before building lighter cumulus highlights. The treatment allowed for both dramatic contrasts and soft atmospheric transitions characteristic of tropical storm lighting conditions.
