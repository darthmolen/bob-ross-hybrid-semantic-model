- Radial diffusion from central light source outward
- Mist appears to drift and settle throughout scene
- Vertical emphasis from tree forms
- Compositional eye movement from bright center to darker edges
- No water flow or active weather patterns

Motion profile: **Still atmospheric diffusion**

## 6. Technique
- **Oval vignette masking** to create framed composition
- **Fan brush** for evergreen tree foliage
- **Liner brush** for delicate bare tree branches
- **Palette knife** for grass highlights and texture
- **Wet-on-wet blending** for misty atmospheric effects
- **Circular blending** for light source halo
- **Stippling and tapping** for foliage texture
- **Dark base glazing** for overall moody foundation
- **Highlight scraping** for grass blade definition

## 7. Narrative Layer
"In this enchanted oval window, twilight settles over a forgotten meadow where ancient trees stand sentinel in the mist. A ghostly light—perhaps moonrise, perhaps memory—glows through the vapor, illuminating the border between the known green earth and the mysterious shadowed forest. The lone bare tree reaches skyward like a keeper of secrets, while the evergreens huddle together in quiet congregation, and all is held in the gentle suspension of fog and fading day."

## 8. Initial Canvas Treatment
Canvas prepared with **Liquid Black** base or dark blue-black gesso mixture to establish moody foundation. The dark base allows for dramatic contrast with the luminous light source and creates the deep atmospheric shadows characteristic of twilight forest scenes. This foundation supports the wet-on-wet technique while maintaining rich darks throughout the oval vignette composition.
