# Season 14, Episode 5 — "Mountain River" (1988)

## 1. Composition
- **Landforms:** Dominant jagged mountain peak with snow-covered ridges; secondary reflected mountain creating perfect symmetry below
- **Water features:** Still alpine lake or river in foreground with mirror-like reflection of mountain and mist
- **Trees/vegetation:** Tall evergreen conifer on left; cluster of evergreens on right; bright deciduous foliage in foreground corners
- **Sky conditions:** Bright blue sky with white cumulus clouds drifting around mountain peak
- **Structures:** None
- **Archetype:** Mountain-and-reflection with misty atmospheric divide

A majestic alpine peak towers above misty forests, its form perfectly mirrored in tranquil waters below.

## 2. Palette
- **Dominant colors:** Phthalo Blue, Titanium White, Midnight Black, Van Dyke Brown, Dark Sienna, Sap Green, Prussian Blue
- **Mountain:** Van Dyke Brown, Dark Sienna, Titanium White for snow and highlights
- **Sky:** Phthalo Blue, Titanium White
- **Trees:** Midnight Black mixed with Prussian Blue for dark evergreens; Sap Green for bright foliage
- **Water:** Phthalo Blue, Titanium White (reflecting sky tones)
- **Mist:** Titanium White

Palette identity: **alpine clarity with atmospheric depth**

## 3. Mood & Atmosphere
- **Tone:** Serene, majestic, pristine wilderness solitude
- **Lighting:** Bright daylight from above, illuminating mountain peak while mist softens midground
- **Atmospheric effects:** Heavy mist or low clouds obscuring mountain base, creating ethereal separation between peak and forest
- **Emotional resonance:** Awe-inspiring scale, peaceful isolation, timeless mountain grandeur

Lighting: **overhead mountain illumination with atmospheric haze**

## 4. Structural Layout
- **Left:** Towering dark evergreen anchoring composition; misty forest edge
- **Right:** Smaller evergreen cluster; bright green deciduous foliage in corner
- **Center:** Commanding mountain peak rising through mist layer; perfect water reflection below
- **Foreground:** Calm water surface with reflection; vibrant green bushes at edges
- **Midground:** Dense white mist band concealing forest base; ghostly tree suggestions
- **Background:** Sharp mountain summit against blue sky; cloud formations

Depth style: **atmospheric layering with mirror symmetry**

## 5. Motion
- **Water flow:** Completely still surface creating flawless reflection
- **Cloud drift:** Gentle horizontal movement around peak
- **Compositional flow:** Strong vertical axis from peak to reflection; diagonal lines of mountain slopes guide eye downward
- **Wind indicators:** None; absolute calm suggested by perfect reflection

Motion profile: **stillness and symmetry**

## 6. Technique
- **Knife work:** Mountain peak construction, snow highlights, rocky faces
- **Brush types:** Fan brush for evergreen foliage; 2-inch brush for sky and mist; liner brush for tree trunks and branches
- **Blending methods:** Wet-on-wet for sky gradations; horizontal strokes for water reflection
- **Special effects:** Mirror reflection technique (pulling colors straight down); mist created with horizontal titanium white strokes; atmospheric perspective through value shifts
- **Highlight technique:** Bright sap green pushed onto foreground bushes

## 7. Narrative Layer
"In the high country where peaks pierce clouds and waters hold perfect stillness, the mountain gazes at its own reflection. Mist wraps the ancient forests in mystery, while sentinel pines stand watch over this sanctuary of silence. Here, nature composes a symphony in stone, water, and light—a reminder that some places exist beyond the reach of time."

## 8. Initial Canvas Treatment
- **Foundation:** Liquid White applied evenly across entire canvas
- **Purpose:** Enables wet-on-wet blending for sky, water, and atmospheric mist transitions
- **Application notes:** Thin coating allowing colors to move and blend seamlessly

The Liquid White base facilitates the smooth gradations essential for both sky-to-mountain transitions and the mirror-perfect water reflection.
