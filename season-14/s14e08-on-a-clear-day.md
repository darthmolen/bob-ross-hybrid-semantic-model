## 4. Structural Layout
- **Left zone:** Tall dark evergreen trees in immediate foreground, creating vertical anchor
- **Right zone:** Matching evergreen trees balancing left side, establishing symmetrical framing
- **Center zone:** Majestic snow-covered mountain peak dominating composition, flanked by smaller ridges
- **Foreground:** Still water surface, dark framing conifers
- **Midground:** Misty lavender valley with distant evergreens creating atmospheric transition
- **Background:** Mountain mass and warm illuminated sky

Depth style: **Strong atmospheric layering with natural frame**

## 5. Motion
- **Water flow:** Calm, still water with no visible current
- **Cloud drift:** Gentle horizontal cloud formations suggesting minimal movement
- **Compositional flow:** Strong vertical pull from foreground trees upward to mountain peak; natural eye path guided through framing trees toward central summit
- **Atmospheric movement:** Soft haze settling in valley suggests stillness

Motion profile: **Vertical ascent with serene stillness**

## 6. Technique
- **Knife work:** Mountain peaks sculpted with bold palette knife strokes; snow highlights applied with knife edge
- **Fan brush:** Dark evergreen trees created with downward fan brush strokes
- **Large brush:** Sky blended with broad horizontal strokes using 2-inch or background brush
- **Soft blending:** Atmospheric haze in valley achieved through gentle cross-blending and feathering
- **Liner brush:** Fine details on distant evergreens and tree branches
- **Special effects:** Pink-lavender atmospheric perspective created by mixing warm and cool tones for misty valley

## 7. Narrative Layer
"On a day of perfect clarity, the mountain stands eternal against a sky ablaze with morning's first light. The dark sentinels of the forest frame this sacred view, their silhouettes a testament to quiet strength. Here, in this moment of crystalline stillness, nature reveals her most magnificent architecture—peaks that pierce the heavens, valleys that cradle the mist, and a golden warmth that promises renewal with each dawn."

## 8. Initial Canvas Treatment
The foundation begins with **Liquid White** or **Liquid Clear** applied evenly across the entire canvas, allowing for smooth blending of the warm sky gradations and seamless atmospheric transitions. This wet-on-wet base enables the soft merging of yellows, oranges, and blues in the celestial backdrop while maintaining the crisp definition needed for the snow-covered mountain peaks. The liquid foundation facilitates the misty lavender haze that settles naturally in the valley.
