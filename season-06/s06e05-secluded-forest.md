- **Water features**: None
- **Trees and vegetation**: Dense vertical birch or aspen grove with light bark, dark evergreens interspersed, lush green ground cover
- **Sky conditions**: Completely obscured by forest canopy
- **Structures**: None
- **Overall compositional archetype**: Vertical forest interior with atmospheric depth

A **vertical birch forest interior** composition emphasizing depth through atmospheric perspective.

## 2. Palette

- **Primary colors used**: Phthalo Blue, Phthalo Green, Prussian Blue, Titanium White, Sap Green, Midnight Black, Van Dyke Brown
- **Warm vs cool**: Strongly cool-biased with blue-green atmospheric dominance
- **High-contrast vs low-contrast**: Moderate contrast between light tree trunks and dark forest shadows
- **Signature color relationships**: Blue-green atmospheric haze against white-highlighted birch bark creates ethereal depth

Palette identity: **cool blue-green woodland palette with luminous birch highlights**

## 3. Mood & Atmosphere

- Mystical and dreamlike
- Serene and quiet
- Cool and shaded
- Atmospheric depth through blue-green haze
- Secluded and intimate

Lighting: **diffuse atmospheric light** filtering through the forest canopy with cool blue-green cast.

## 4. Structural Layout

Motion profile: **vertical static rhythm with atmospheric depth recession**

## 6. Technique

- Liquid White or light blue base for atmospheric effect
- Fan brush for evergreen foliage
- Palette knife for birch tree trunks with highlighted edges
- Vertical dragging strokes for tree bark texture
- Horizontal blending for atmospheric haze effect
- Feathering technique for soft background trees
- Push-up strokes for ground grass

Signature technique: **palette knife birch trunks with highlighted edges against blue-green atmospheric haze**

## 7. Narrative Layer
