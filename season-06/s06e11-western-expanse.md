## 1. Composition

- **Landforms**: Gentle rolling hills and low mountain range in the distant background
- **Water features**: Calm pond or small lake in the middle ground with mirror-like surface
- **Trees and vegetation**: Single prominent evergreen tree on left foreground, small evergreen bushes in middle ground, sparse vegetation on grassy plains
- **Sky conditions**: Dramatic cloudy sky with sweeping cloud formations, purple and blue tones with white highlights
- **Structures**: None
- **Overall compositional archetype**: Open prairie landscape with water reflection

An expansive horizontal landscape emphasizing wide open space with minimal vertical elements.

## 2. Palette

- **Primary colors used**: Prussian Blue and Phthalo Blue for sky and water, Alizarin Crimson for sky warmth, Sap Green for foliage, Van Dyke Brown and Dark Sienna for earth tones, Titanium White for highlights and clouds, Yellow Ochre for grassy areas
- **Warm vs cool**: Cool-dominant palette with purple-blue sky, balanced by warm earth tones in foreground
- **High-contrast vs low-contrast**: Moderate contrast between dark foreground tree and light sky, softer transitions in middle ground

## 5. Motion

- Cloud formations sweeping across the sky
- Calm, still water with no current
- Horizontal compositional flow from left to right
- Gentle atmospheric drift in cloud patterns
- Visual path from foreground tree through water to distant mountains

Motion profile: **horizontal sweep with atmospheric drift**

## 6. Technique

- Wet-on-wet blending for dramatic sky
- Criss-cross strokes for cloud formations
- Fan brush evergreens with push-up strokes
- Palette knife for distant mountain shapes
- Pull-down reflections in water with horizontal smoothing
- Light feathering for grassy areas
- Vertical trunk strokes for foreground tree
- Subtle highlights on water surface

Signature technique: **sweeping sky blends over horizontal landscape planes**

## 7. Narrative Layer

"A vast western prairie opens before the viewer, where a solitary evergreen stands watch over a tranquil pond. The dramatic sky sweeps overhead with purple and blue clouds, while distant mountains fade into the atmospheric haze. The scene captures the quiet grandeur and peaceful solitude of wide-open western landscapes."

## 8. Initial Canvas Treatment
