- **Trees and vegetation**: Sparse evergreens on the right side, bare deciduous trees in foreground left and center-right, lush ground cover of bright grasses
- **Sky conditions**: Dramatic sunset sky with explosive color radiating from the horizon, layered cloud formations
- **Structures**: None

- **High-contrast vs low-contrast**: High contrast between the fiery sky and darker landforms, moderate contrast in the meadow areas
